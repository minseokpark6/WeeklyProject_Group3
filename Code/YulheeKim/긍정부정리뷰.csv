There is only a curtain separating the suite from their house. No coffee left or sugar, hardly any shampoo or conditioner. The fan she blamed us on breaking was already broken which made the stay very hot. Not sure about the doorbell she brought up.

A wild bird somehow entered the apartment while I was sleeping the first night. I woke up to it flying around frantically. Messaged the hosts but did not hear back from them for about 5 hours. Instead, got an automated response from them an hour later saying something to the tune of, "" Hope everything is great!"" Everything was, in fact, not great. I got the bird out myself, but it was an incredibly stressful way to start the day. When I finally did hear from them, they said ""Let us know, we can send someone to help."" I had messaged them at 8am; it was now 1pm. I told them I was dissatisfied with their response time and lack of urgency. I was expecting them to offer at the very least an explanation of how the bird got in, as no windows were open. Was really hoping for some kind of half refund for the day.

You can hear people in the hallway since the apartment is located right at the front door. We felt safe and secure. Yes, the neighborhood is lower income, but there were 0 issues. Residents were polite.  The instructions for getting into the apartment were incorrect. Diana wasn't very professional when I was explaining that the codes were not working. More than once she said we were doing something wrong and questioning my reading comprehension skills. She finally realized she provided the wrong codes in the listing and texted what I imagine were the check in instructions I should have received originally but did not. She didn't apologize until I said hey you could've just listened to me originally instead of talking down to me.

The kitchen has so many utensils, cup, mugs, and the like. It is like a chef‚Äôs kitchen. It is very spacious and quite. In short, it is a beautiful place but not suitable if you have toddlers. I have a toddler. The outside ambiance is more of a commercial area. I believe the place is a radio station before. The front door facing towards the street, if I am not mistaken, someone tried to open the door at evening, but it is not an issue because we managed on how to deal with it and I didn‚Äôt bother to call the attention of the host because it was just nothing.

Day of travel host said the listing was ""unfortunately due to unforeseen circumstances The original unit you selected is unavailable."" I accepted the change. Got to the unit quite late after day of flights. The rear door was completely unlocked, and looked like it had previously been broken into. Led to a very creepy staircase with people talking. The unit did not reflect the unit I had previously reserved and there was no change in cost. The previous unit was able to be reserved that same night at a higher price. Airbnb refunded  and cancelled the rest of my stay.","['like', 'led', 'refunded']","['decline', 'unfortunately', 'unforeseen', 'unavailable', 'broken', 'creepy']"

The house is on a quiet street adjacent to an easily walkable small strip of restaurants, liquor store, and convenience store. We ate at Albany Ale & Oyster... maybe a 3 minute walk away?... and had such great service and delicious food.

So walking on the cold floor daily was a sad reminder. Even though the host was responsive, it was frustrating to have to call consistently about the same concern so I stopped reaching out. They were really nice and apologized for the inconvenience and invited me back. I would give it another try, as long as the heat is fixed ü•∂.","['great', 'lovely', 'great', 'enjoyed', 'super', 'responsive', 'helpful', 'spacious', 'well', 'fine', 'recommended', 'responsive', 'consistently', 'nice']","['concern', 'frigid', 'cold', 'cold', 'sad', 'frustrating', 'concern', 'inconvenience']"

While we appreciated the extra space to spread out, I feel like the unit didn't live up to the price tag. It's an older apartment, so the plugs are in weird places and it seems like there was a remodel that was either abandoned or in progress, especially around the bathroom. Other details felt too thrifty, like the ironing board that was meant to be used on a kitchen table that the unit doesn't have, or the DYI headboard in one of the rooms. <br/>The parking on the street is pretty convenient, except for the period when you need to move the car once a week. There didn't seem to be much in the neighborhood, though, so it's really just a place to stay near Albany.<br/>For a little less money per night, we were able to book a hotel in Troy a few nights later and have all of the conveniences we were looking for, minus the living room and extra bedroom.

Huge windows that let in so much natural light, comfy couches, spacious bathroom...felt quite nice! Water bottles and coffee were left for us and everything felt clean and pristine. <br/>The area left little to be desired. The building is next to a police station, housing authority, rescue mission, and tons of closed businesses. This is not Diana's fault though, as once you got into the building, you feel secure and safe. The parking lot was not very secure, and someone was using the hood of my car as a place to put their wares as they were passing through. <br/>Diana's guidebook was incredibly outdated, as most of the restaurants listed are permanently closed. You are close to a lot of good restaurants...you just have to do a bit of leg work ahead of time. <br/>Diana was a DELIGHT to work with, though. Relatively fast responding via text, very kind and patient, and took care of us!

I found the folks in the neighbourhood to be really friendly while we were out for walks with our dog. There was a camera located in the parking area as well as the building and at no point did I feel unsafe, even when walking the dog at 11pm. This building was a former school with a lot of history. The building was clean. The unit was immaculate. Host provided everything in the kitchen we needed to cook our meals. Lark St was very close by as well as the 787 (Troy was a short 15 minute drive and highly recommend heading there to Tatu Tacos and Tequila or for the farmers market). Host was the most responsive I have encountered so far and even asked us to message when we arrived (we were coming from Canada) to let her know we made it safely.

By far this was the most comfy, cozy, and relaxing stay I have had in an AirBnb property.

There were so many cool places to eat and be entertained within walking distance. I wish I could have taken the upstairs view back home with us! Lol. Nice juxtaposition of abundant nature (cute birds & squirrels! Hehe) mixed with statuesque imagery of downtown buildings. Saratoga Springs/Ballston Spa area is a relatively quick trip via highway. We were back and forth from Albany to Skidmore College and the AirBnb was a pleasant/relaxing end to our busy days.

As I was getting ready to go check out the listing, a women on the sidewalk approached me saying that these guys were following her and that she didn‚Äôt feel safe. Red flag #1.

The couch pillows were stained, the kitchen had food crumbs from previous visitors, the floors needed swept, and we did not trust the towels and sheets (also stained) to be clean. To be fair, we did not reach out to Julia about the problems we experienced, largely because our issues were with the apartment as a whole which could not be fixed by one person at 9:30pm.

There were also a stain on the desk, and we found strands of hair left over on the bed when we had arrived.

Also, a park nearby for a beautiful walk in an urban area. The apartment is well kept and clean. It is on the first floor so it is an easy walk up to the door. Also, this is a very quiet space even though it is a city dwelling. We loved the place and would highly recommend it. We would definitely stay again. And, finally, as this was our first trip to Albany, and we would definitely visit again. Amazing architecture with a great food scene, and outdoor space to enjoy nature along the Hudson River. Once again, walkable to the river walk/path for running, cycling or walking from the apartment.","['excellent', 'loved', 'enjoyed', 'beautiful', 'well', 'clean', 'easy', 'quiet', 'loved', 'recommend', 'amazing', 'great', 'enjoy']",[]

The place was perfectly situated for our needs in Albany, NY.  It was within walking distance of many things. As an upstairs of a Brownstone-style building, it would have been helpful to have explained the steepness of the entrance to the building and of the upstairs dwelling. We loved the historical vibe it created, but anyone with bad knees will find the climb challenging. The description said there was a back deck. It's more of a landing, a small strip of deck with stairs leading to the top of the garage, which guests are not permitted to go on. It seems more like an emergency exit than a deck, as there is nowhere to sit. The lighting in the sitting room/living room could have been better arranged. There was only an overhead light which was too bright. The one couch had no support. We sat on it and instantly sunk into it. You can see their improvements to the space, but it's not 5 stars yet.","['perfectly', 'helpful', 'loved', 'leading', 'top', 'like', 'better', 'bright', 'support', 'instantly', 'improvements']","['bad', 'challenging', 'emergency', 'sunk']"

The photos do not show the incredible amount of mold in the middle bathroom. It‚Äôs growing on the vent and from the sockets and switches. The unit was also not cleaned well, the floors especially. We arrived late and exhausted and since we were only staying one more night and would only be in the unit a limited time, we stayed. If it had been any longer we would have cancelled and reached out to support. I did notify the owner of our issues (and sent photos) in case they were not aware of how bad the problems were.

I finally received a response more than 5 hours later via AirBnB. There was no response from the listed phone number.

Virtually no disturbances throughout the night and in the daytime.<br/>Sean himself was always reachable and eager to help. The water pressure in the shower was low and we contacted Sean who then sent a plumber the very next day.

It was immaculate and with both an AC unit and a really effective dehumidifier, it was very comfortable climate-wise. The apartment was also surprisingly quiet, considering that it is a garden-level (mostly below ground) unit with shared walls on both sides and an inhabited floor above. So, if you are looking for a quiet place to rewind at the end of the day, or to do some work in the evening, this is a good spot. Sean was remarkably easy to reach and delightful to deal with. As others before me have noted, the unit has been tastefully redone recently and has a marvelous walk-in shower. The kitchen is also very well done. Only one slightly not positive thing (I liked this place so much that I didn't want to use the word ""negative""): the unit is not large.  But I will gladly hope it will be available the next time I need to overnight in Albany.

A couple areas could have been vacuumed better - the sofa pull out frame and the kitchen cabinets. During the day you can hear everyone upstairs, def no sound insulation.

A few walls are slanted, making it awkward to walk through, but easily adaptable. Didn't like that the shower has no room to move around, making it feel claustrophobic.

But the living space isn't that comfortable for 8. There's only dining and couch seating for 4 (in fairness Nori let me know about the dining before I booked). This was fine since we had a short stay and mostly were only there to sleep. But it would be more difficult for a large group that is planning to spend more time at the home. The neighborhood seemed ok - there are a handful of commercial areas within walking distance, but I think you'd mostly need a rental car if you're staying here.","['nice', 'clean', 'comfortable', 'like', 'comfortable', 'comfortable', 'fairness', 'fine']","['trash', 'difficult']"

We hope they were addressed and will not continue to affect future guests.

The grill is about three flights down the porch stairs though but not a problem for me but something to be aware of. The only issue really was that the back porch was cute but it was dusty from pollen and it would have been nice if had been cleaned off. But overall that wasn‚Äôt a big deal at all. It was humid and the AC worked great and there was a fan too which I needed for the street noise at night. I‚Äôm a light sleeper! <br/>Overall we had a great stay.

I dropped my bags to check out the patio that had a beautiful description with fire pit, grill and furniture. I move the curtain and immediately I think, oh shoot Queens been robbed! The only thing outside was an empty bird feeder and a planter with no flowers. I contacted Queen. Allegedly she was waiting for new. Everything I bought for 2 days was for outdoor cooking and firewood for a bonfire. Queen did send me $75 dollars but I was NOT happy. One towel and washcloth for 2 days and there were 2 of us. Food left in microwave from someone previous. Opened bottles of wine on wine rack. Dish towels that appeared to never had been washed. Missing top sheet on bed. No bodywash or shampoo. No dish soap.

Also, there was not much in the line of cooking and baking supplies. No cutting board, which we had to buy and nothing for serving food. We were there to celebrate Christmas with our family and cooking was difficult. We were able to borrow things from my son‚Äôs home, which was close by. The biggest issue for me was that there were no smoke detectors or carbon monoxide detectors. Once I noticed this, I didn‚Äôt sleep well being that I had 2 grandchildren sleeping down the hall.

Things to note, you have no control over the thermostat and other tenants in the building do not deadbolt the main door to get inside. I had no issues with either of these things and will reiterate that I felt totally safe in both the neighborhood and the building. There is some low-level periodic noise from the bus line that runs in front of house, you barely hear anyone from the other apartments.

Not only that, but there were two very small, flat and old pillows on the bed and there were no extras to be found, making the sleeping experience uncomfortable. It felt disappointing to have paid to stay in a place that had not taken the comfort of their guests into consideration at all. For future stays, I recommend that this host upgrade their bedding and do their laundry in a place that is smoke free.","['convenient', 'friendly', 'clear', 'accurate', 'clean', 'strong', 'ready', 'comfort', 'recommend', 'free']","['smell', 'cold', 'tattered', 'uncomfortable', 'disappointing', 'smoke']"

The location was very desirable and safe. The apartment itself was comfortable although the renovation job wasn't the best.  For example, the floors are uneven and some boards stick up (watch your toes!), the doors don't latch very well (bathroom in particular), and the back door should really have a deadbolt lock instead of just a knob lock. There was also a lot of dust on the fans and fixtures, so I'd rate the cleanliness as just OK. The hallway outside the unit was filthy with construction dust which forced us to remove shoes in the apartment (thankfully we travel with house shoes). Elizabeth was very nice, but it was clear that English wasn't her first language as some of the instructions didn't make sense. For example, it took me 15 min to locate the unit because the incorrect unit info was given. The address also didn't match exactly.

Phat met us upon entry and was pleasant and helpful in getting us situated. He even suggested a place where we could eat. The house's location is great - quite near Empire State Plaza and many of Albany's popular sights, as well as near the Albany-Rensselauer train station.

Biggest downside to this home is the fact that there are upstairs neighbors. I stayed here for the bar exam, so I needed quiet at night. Although quiet hours for the Air BnB start at 10pm, the upstairs neighbors were making quite a bit of noise until about 11:30pm. (I don't think they were unreasonably loud, but the layout of the home makes upstairs noise inevitable, since the upstairs neighbors live directly above your bedroom, so when they move around, drop stuff, scoot chairs, you hear it all - which can make it hard to sleep). I'll also add that there's not a ton of decorations - this is a fairly simple home, but it has the essentials (couch, TV, microwave, fridge, bed, etc)!","['nice', 'clean', 'clean', 'incredibly', 'flexible', 'refund', 'quiet', 'nice', 'quiet', 'quiet', 'fairly']","['downside', 'noise', 'unreasonably', 'loud', 'noise', 'inevitable', 'hard']"

My family only stayed about 9 hours to sleep. <br/>One disappointing aspect was that we were exhausted driving 14 hours from Indiana and got in about 10:45pm. Knowing quiet hours begin at 10pm and out of respect for the neighbors above we were very careful to be quiet and soft in all we did. However, in less than 10 minutes of our arrival Maria was messaging me that the neighbors above were complaining about our noise. I assume it was the older home with squeaky floors or the door that makes noise as we entered. Nevertheless we were in bed quickly and we were gone by 8am. <br/>So, clean home. Good host. But picky neighbors above. So if you're not extremely careful, this isn't the best fit. <br/>Overall it was worth the stay.

The signs were clear on what days and times not to park. Additionally, the location of this home was close to all the activities we did. It was about a 15 minute drive to the NY Capitol, museum of Art and the NYS museum, Empire State Plaza and its observation Deck, and Albany Pine Bush. About a 30 minute drive to Saratoga and exploring their natural springs.

And eversince, they run up to the app for the most flimpsy issues while smiling with me before writing the negative comments. This to me is callous and hypocritical. For example, I woke up one morning to see a review that I was loud overnight. I called Thomas and asked how could I be loud when I was asleep all night. I queried whether I was snoring and maybe that could be the meaning of being loud. He said it wasn't snoring that it was a ""hard"" noise.
