And the staircase and hallway was bright, the apartment was super clean and comfortable. The rooms clearly marked, every amenity one could wish for. Coffee, water cooler, hot shower, lots of towels, bedside lamp, convenient electric receptacle and comfy bed, all for a bargain price. Manny could teach many airbnbs how to equip their rentals. I hope to have the pleasure to be invited back! Wishing you the best from San Diego! üå¥\n",

      "It's always great to stay at Manny's!\n",
      "We stayed here only for one night, everything was clean, the bed was comfortable, the apartment was quiet, the host has many conditions and rules and questions which must be answered before confirming the reservation, which is an advantage that only decent people stay here, but it takes some time to study it all if you are traveling fast and don't have much time to read long list of rules.We travelling by car from Niagara Falls which is about 8 hours of drive and we  couldn‚Äôt make it on time of check in untill 12:00 PM, we asked if we can arrive later, host kindly extend arrival time untill 1 AM. We make it on time but it was quite tight for us and we were under pressure on road to make it untill deadline.\n",

      "The stay was wonderful and the host was so helpful and responsive.\n",
      "I only got to stay here one night, but after a long trip through New York, Manny's place was the exact thing I needed! Manny provided amenities I didn't even realize I needed until I got there, and he obviously put a lot of care and consideration into providing everything a traveler could need when trying to relax. Manny was so accommodating that he even offered me a ride to the airport to make my early morning flight on time, providing me a much needed sense of relief and one less thing to stress about. This will be the only place I'll be staying in the next time I travel to New York through EWR. Thank you a thousand times, Manny!\n",

      "At first I was taken aback by the lengths to which Manny went to make sure my identification was correct and that I understood the house rules, but then I realized that his efforts also made me 100% certain that the other guests were good and respectful too! I loved the plentiful parking, quite residential feel, and delicious Mexican food only two blocks away. Surprising quiet for being so close to the Newark airport. I felt more at home here than any other NY/Newark place I have ever stayed. Definitely this is where I will return!\n",

      "Great\n",
      "It's a real room, a bathroom, and it's clean, and the bed is so fluffy. The room is bigger than I thought, and there's a water purifier! However, there is no such thing as a big chain in the neighborhood, but most of the grocery stores are sold and the Jersey Garden Mall is close, so there are a lot of them in there. The host is really nice and satisfying. I think it would be easier to get around if I had a car..Manny is the best host ever. So friendly and helpful. The house was SUPER CLEAN and the bed was so comfy. Room was bigger than i thought and i really enjoyed staying in there.\n",

I needed a quick and cheap place to stay.The duplex was quiet, clean and nice.I got my own room with number code door lock.The kitchen had paper towels , microwave, filter water and other items.Many restaurants walking distance but none that are good. You can also do Uber eats for better quality foods.Airport lyft round trip from this place runs $25\n",
      "Give Manny's place a try! You'll really love the whole scenario. Clean, quiet, amenities like coffee, washer and dryer,  tooth brushes, his most recent offering of filtered drinking water, and of course the price and location.What's not to love??Check it out, you won't be disappointed!!\n",

      "Manny communicated well with us. And the bedroom was how it was described. The beds where super comfortable. And you couldn‚Äôt hear anyone in the other rooms. Great apartment.\n",
      "A fusion between a Traditional Airbnb and a Hotel, clean, cool (cold if you want it) and close to so many places, if you simply want to get a place near the airport so it‚Äôs easy to fly out Manny‚Äôs is great for that. But it‚Äôs also great for exploring Elizabeth Seaport and the Jersey Gardens Mall, with a so much authentic Restaurants from Mediterranean and Latin Cultures. This place is Worth Booking.\n",
      "Wouldn‚Äôt Recommend checkin process tedious and host was rude thru message worst checkin experiences every and i have over 100 reviews\n",
      "Guest was notified several times that a valid goverment ID was required to check-in. Guest didnt follow check-in instructions and when asked to present ID he gave an attitude. Definately not welcome back.\n",
