"Great location, close to restaurants, market, bus stop and metro station however the place is extremely loud at night with the skate park across the street and restaurants close by.  The place is as described in the pictures but there was a smell that my family didn't like unless all the windows are kept opened."
"Pro: location near the train station, if you don‚Äôt mind taking the train almost everywhere and know how to use the metro. The neighborhood is family oriented, you have everything at walking 10min distance. Great restaurants, great shopping, SAFE, friendly French! üòç A playground/park for kids with the view of the ET. Nearby Covid testing site at a pharmacy.  Laundromat also nearby. The train is 5min next door. Eiffel Tower is 15 min walking distance.  (If this is your first time in Paris, and likes to walk everywhere go stay in St Germain.) The room/bathroom are very large for Paris standards. A family of 2a and 2 kids would be comfortable.  The small kitchen is handy, but no microwave.  Con: the apartment needs upkeep. Light fixture don‚Äôt work, falling off the wall, the sofa bed dirty!!!. And is broken noisy and uncomfortable. We had to put the mattress on the floor. The heater is a small space heater.  Older tv, not smart tv, cannot connect to Netflix or such. All French channels. The communication with the host was faulty, they say they are available from 9 to midnight, they are NOT. Also every prob we had I had to send a picture before it got resolved, if it ever got resolved, like the dirty sheets we found when we arrived after our 8 hours flight at 9pm. Building is under construction. Very noisy!"
"I would not recommend anyone to stay in this place.  1. It was not clean 2. Very far from main city area and metro station 3. Host was unresponsive and was not available on call/ whats app 4. Difficult to find the place 5. Check in was delayed as there was no one to attend us. Wasted one day caused we had to wait for the host 6. Host was not available to guide for the directions 7. Breakfast was mentioned but it was not served 8.  Extremely small toilet, no place to move an inch as well 8. No cupboards/ wardrobes/ table to keep your luggage, we had to keep everything on floor. 10. host was not polite and comments like "" its not a hotel""  Overall a bad experience."
Good location next to a metro station and 10 minute walk from Eiffel tower. Small as expected but fine for a couple. However there there‚Äôs not one piece of decoration on the walls and the shower is not a proper shower like shown on photos. Plus the toilet seat was broken. Host said it was due to previous travellers however I‚Äôm disappointed I never got told any of this before my stay therefore was not happy with my stay.
"The appartement is nicely located near many stations, it also has a lift which I found very useful, images were fairly accurate. However upon arrival there were a couple things I found bizzare: a laundry basket filled with dirty clothes, no wardrobe space which was originally shown I was going to get in the pictures, dishes that were left out, the layer of dirt and mould surrounding the shower, layers of dust and hair on the surfaces, and  plug sockets/ lights would randomly stop working. I was excited to stay here as it had some great reviews but was left quite unsatisfied"
"Our goals were low price, real bed, bathtub/shower and close to a Metro station.  We got all of them!  Good bed, great water pressure and 5 min walk to the largest metro/train station in Europe (Gar du Nord).  Dominique was very welcoming and had a number of reference materials for us and suggestions on restaurants and markets.  The area may look a bit ‚Äúshady‚Äù but we had no troubles walking to the station, restaurant or market in the evening hours.  We were able to explore Paris for 4 days - came home each night exhausted and happy.  Au revoir Paris."
"I stayed at this apartment with my sister.  Aleinor was at the apartment to meet us.  Unfortunately, she spoke very little English and we speak very little French so communication was difficult.  She also seemed to be in a bit of a hurry. The apartment was very clean but tiny.  We ended up sharing the bed in the bedroom as the futon in the other very tiny room didn't look very inviting.  It was a big enough bed, though, and as we are sisters, it wasn't a big deal.  The unit was not stocked with too much.  We had to go purchase toilet paper.  There was no detergent for the washing machine but we ended up not using it anyway.  All in all, though, once we got used to it's compactness, it was all right.  We had trouble with the TV as it would suddenly stop working and there was a message in French about what to do (I believe it had to do with the internet but we couldn't figure it out) When I texted Alienor, she did get back to me to try to help. I believe she may even had come to fix it while we were out but then it happened again.  You can't really see outside as the windows are high unless you stand on something to look out so you may not want to stay here if you are claustrophobic.  No AC but a fan.  It is very well located, within walking distance to Notre Dame and the Left bank and not far from metro stations. "
"The location is very convenient close to Italian Place Metro station 3 mins by walk, and there is a shopping mall and supermarket opposite to the flat. The room is cozy and clean, and there is a desk in your room. But the floor always creaking when I walk, I was so worrying to disturb Catherine that always walk very carefully ; no dry and wet partition in the shower room and no shaded curtain in the room. And please note if you have a big luggage cos it is on the top 5th floor, that is really not easy to carry by you alone!"
"K√©miie‚Äôs place is located about 40 minutes away by public transport from most major sites and about a 20 minute walk from the Paris Nord train station. Upon our arrival, around 7 pm in the evening, our towels were still damp and we had to take cold showers because the hot water heater had been turned off (after turning the hot water heater on, we waited about 45 minutes for the water to get warmer but it was still cold. Since we were only in Paris a short time, we wanted to quickly shower before going out). K√©miie gave us a heads up and let us know about the damp towels and was apologetic about the cold showers. The apartment is pretty loud and the bed/pillows weren‚Äôt great but both were tolerable. The worst (almost intolerable) part about K√©miie‚Äôs place is the smell coming from the bathroom. We had to leave the bathroom door shut at all times because the odor would make us feel physically sick. It smelled like someone dying in there mixed with the worst possible mildew smell. This needs to be addressed immediately in my opinion before anyone else stays there."
"Great location.  Walking distance to Eiffel Tower, to the Sienne and to metro stations.  Supermarket close by as well as the shopping mall!!  Only one failing was no cloth for drying dishes and sponge was not new. Happily replaced the sponge ."
CANCELLED a couple hours before check in time. I tried communicating two days before arrival and the again the day before as well as day of check in and no communication. When I arrived in Paris I received a cancellation without explanation. Was left to find last minute accommodations while in the train station in Paris. Avoid yourself the headache.
"This is a small simple apartment with a full size bed low to the ground.  It is comfortable.  There are many stairs with no elevator option to get to apartment.  If you have an mobility issues this is not the place to stay.  Be aware if you arrive late at night the street looks very dark but during the day looks completely differently and welcoming.   There are 3 different locks to get into the apartment from the front of the building, review checkin instructions in advance.  Very close to train station and restaurants/bars.  There is a washer and dryer but no detergent.  There is also a coffee maker but no coffee pods.  So amenities are limited.    Could use a personal touch."
"Positive: - Beds were comfortable. - Convenient location - near a train station, grocery stores, near some tourist spots. - Quiet at night. - Secure courtyard entry. - Enough toiletries included. Negative: - The en suite shower ran out of hot water suddenly after the first day and we just used the one outside. - The outside bathroom's shower had a strange smell coming from the drain initially but it went away. - Missing a dryer; in the initial listing, a clothes dryer was included in the amenities list. This was quite an important factor in my decision to book this place. But when we arrived, we could not find the dryer so I messaged the host, who simply said there is no dryer. If it wasn't getting late at this point we would have just changed to a different place. I would not have booked this without a dryer."
"Unfortunately we could not share the positive experiences of former visitors - Anais apartement is big enough and the area of town is really great and close to two major train stations. However, it was very clear the apartement had not been cleaned when we arrived: The trashbins where full to the brim with mouldy smelling garbage, the apartement had not been vacuumed and the kitchen and the bathroom had not been cleaned - the toilet smelled, the sink in the kitchen was dirty, everything looked grimy. My towel smelled old and had lots of long dark hairs in it. (I am blonde).  In no way would I ever stay there again, it was very very unpleasant."
Amazing! My family was satisfied with it. kind of noise at night but no problem with ear plugs and no condiments but no problem as we could come back at late night. We could get everywhere by subway which was 1-2mins on foot and get fresh bread by the good bakery which was just front of subway station. will stay again during our next visit in Paris.
"The apartment is quite secure, since you have to pass 3 locked doors to get to it. It's small, but has all the necessary amenities to cook food and wash yourself. Everything was clean; there was a bad smell coming from the bathroom, but could be stopped by closing the drains. There are supermarkets and restaurants close by. It only takes 2 minutes to get to the metro station."
Everything went smooth and as described. The only thing I missed was the black out curtains. Close to the markets and a 5 minutes walk from the RER station.
"Overall ... highly recommend Michel's apartment.  Well worth the price.  You can't beat the ambiance of the place, nor the wonderful hospitality that Michel offers.  My girlfriend and I stayed for three nights and we have already recommended to friends and family that they consider it for any future stays in Paris.  Why not a perfect 5 rating?  First, I would say that my true rating would be a 4.5, as the two negatives are very minor and I don't believe would take away from anybody's trip to any significant level.  Those two things are:  1. The immediate street that the apartment is on is not overly fantastic.  Don't get me wrong, it's not horrible, but it's also not the ideal romantic quaint street of Paris that you find in many areas of the city.  The plus is that the metro is very close - Bastille is a  five minute walk and another smaller station is no more than 90 seconds away.  2. The noise level was not ideal.  You do easily hear people in other apartments, and in the morning the sounds of a nearby school are very obvious.  Again, I can't stress enough that neither of the two negative comments above would keep me from recommending Michel's apartment, nor would they keep me from renting it again.  WELL WORTH EVERY DOLLAR/EURO TO STAY HERE!!!"
"I liked what a previous reviewer did, so I will do the same.  The great:  Property is close to metro stations which is a plus.  It is on the ground level which makes it easy when carrying luggage.  It is very quiet private area.  Felt very safe as property was inside a private courtyard and door was double bolted.  The good: Property has washer and dryer which came in very handy, just make sure you bring detergent.  The dryer doesn‚Äôt fully dry so I suggest you wash at night and let clothes air dry all night. Bathroom had a towel warmer which helped dry towels and also clothes that were too thick to dry on their own quickly.  The ok: Property has a heater but it is not very user friendly. No instructions left, so had to figure it out on my own.  No toiletries left really for almost a whole week stay. Had to go out and buy, shampoo, toilet paper and tissue as only one roll was left (2 girls stayed).  Only 2 towels left, no hand towels. The sofa mattress is not the most comfortable.  Only a duffet cover was left to cover yourself with (no flat sheet) and 2 pillows that were more euro pillows, but standard.  I didn‚Äôt see the bed on the 2nd level, but my daughter said it was ok, so I‚Äôll take her word for it.  Now the ladder to the 2nd level can be scary, so make sure who ever sleeps up there is careful, especially while getting down‚Ä¶don‚Äôt let them get up/down by themselves if they are sleepy. It is not stable. Shower is very small.  Not suitable for a large person. Also, be VERY careful when showing as the piping/shower head fixture gets extremely hot too. I burned myself quite a few times.  The ugly: I think this is very important for everyone to know as it is NO  WHERE on the description of property.  The MOLD in the bathroom! In my opinion it is horrible.  No property should be rented out with that much mold in bathroom.  Someone mentioned on their review about mold back in December, but their review said it was being taken care of soon which made me believe it would be done by the time we went, WRONG!  Owner said they were waiting for it to dry and that it was getting fixed in May. I don‚Äôt think they should rent it out until that is done, just my opinion.  It is all around the toilet wall underneath the water heater and on opposite wall as well.  Paint is bubbly in many areas of bathroom because of the water damage.  There you go, my true honest opinion. Would I stay there again? No."
It was okay. Very very close to metro station. The surface could be more clean. He provided me to flex hours . But language barrier was problem
"Nice place, convenient for a family with two children, close to two metro stations. Only problem was trying to prepare meals with the very limited facilities. There is a microwave and induction hob, but no oven as listed, and the hob barely works with the pans provided."
The place is great near everywhere  Metro station is 2 small blocks away also MONOPRIX a grocery store. Important to point out that if you have any issues with joints or difficulty walking do not rent the place it is 3rd floor no elevator
1. Best thing about Europe especially Paris is its public transport network. You can reach any place via public transport. In that regard Katerina‚Äôs place is with in say 200 meters from nearest metro station.  2. Food: We found a Chinese restaurant close to above mentioned metro station which became our favorite spot. Food was excellent. There are so many other options near by.  3. Safety: inside Katerina‚Äôs place and inside apartment we felt very safe. But I can‚Äôt say the same for Paris. ANY FUTURE TRAVELERS SHOULD BE EXTRA CAUTIOUS WHEN YOU ARE IN PUBLIC. HAD A VERY BAD EXPERIENCE FROM SUBWAY TRAIN.  Note: I REPEAT EXTRA CAUTIOUS IN PUBLIC PLACE. PARIS IS NOT SAFE AFTER SUNSET. AND SUBWAYS ARE NOT SAFE DURING PEAK HOURS.  One word I can find for Katerina‚Äôs place is PERFECT.
"Place is  very convenient location very close to a Metro station. It was quiet at night. The only issue we found were some ‚Äúworking‚Äù ladies close to the apartment, which seemed to attract some undesirable attention."
"The apartment was as described, clean and tidy and had what we needed. Walking distance to a couple of metro stations and you can easily walk to and explore P√®re Lachaise cemetery (P√®re Lachaise metro is a few minutes walk). The area can be noisy in the evenings, but this isn‚Äôt the hosts fault of course! We also had a water outage on the last morning, but again not the hosts fault and they quickly responded to any messages we sent. Would definitely stay here again."
Staying location is about 15mins walk from station. Difficult to locate.
"We were supposed to receive a message 2 days before arrival in October with instructions on how to get the key badge to enter the apartment, but we never got it. I messaged him 4 hours before check in (3pm) and I never heard back. Messaged again twice, after arrival at train station and when standing at his front door,  but still nothing. Customer service finally refunded my payment after waiting the required one hour after their attempt to contact him with no response back. Luckily I was able to book a hotel listed in Airbnb with no problem and checked in at 5pm. Don‚Äôt book this apartment or you will risk wasting your valuable time in Paris. Matthieu will not respond. Don‚Äôt believe his textbook apology he gave to someone else about his dirty apartment in September. It means nothing because worse happened to us - we were left hanging. At least we got compensated by Airbnb $75 for our inconvenience. This apartment listing should be removed. Horrible. Shame on you Matthieu."
Place was amazing! No issues or concerns.  Located in a very walkable neighborhood with train station less than a block away
"The place is nicely decorated. It is close to a metro station but somewhat far from all turistic attractics. The beds lack enough pillows and blankets. Although we took most of the trash to a public container as host requested and left no trash visible, still complained to us about it as if there was no cleaning fee. Biggest downside would be demanding attitude from the host which makes you feel unwelcomed."
"Selim's place it's ok, not the badest but not the best. If your a tall person watch your head. The studio it's close to a metro station(Convention), Selim is doing his best to help his guests. Thank you!"
"Let‚Äôs start with the thing I like the most. The location is amazing! 5 min walk to the metro station and everything is fairly close! She was nice enough to let us drop off our bags before check in time. On the other side I had problems with some amenities and the pictures are not update, for a minute we thought we were in the wrong apartment. Unfortunately communication was not the best. She only texted me for the check in and check out and didn‚Äôt respond to any of my concerns until the check out time. And it was list as a basic kitchen with the basics like salt, pepper and oil. That was on the listing and unfortunately was not the case. We had to buy all those things and I wouldn‚Äôt mind but we had to go to the market twice because she did let me know there was no shampoo or soup but didn‚Äôt let me know about the ‚Äúkitchen basic‚Äù. That was not expected. Overall I will give a 4 star. Because of the location."
"Location is ideal, located near a station where 3 subway lines intersects. The room is clean and cozy and the bed is comfy. The neighborhood is a bit dirty and noisy at night due to the number of night clubs and bars in the proximity but for me it all became background noise so didn‚Äôt bother me much. "
"Good location, near to two subway stations. The apartment was apparently clean, however the around the building not. Opening the window the smell of garbage was strong, also the smell of dog. Building really old, but the apartment was ok. My boyfriend had problems on the first day with hot water in shower, that finished in the accumulator and several times we had problem with wifi connection."
"erick sent us instructions on how to self-check in a few days before hand since he wasn‚Äôt going to be there, no problem; however, he sent us check in instructions to one of his other airbnb‚Äôs, so we were stuck outside unable to get it. he took over 45 minutes to reply to us and another 15 to show up to help us check in. as an apology he gave us a bottle of wine for our troubles. erick said we could message him on whatsapp if we had any questions, but when i took him up on that he took over 12 hours to reply. overall unresponsive host, if you get the right check in information to begin with then it won‚Äôt be that bad. the apartment itself was in a nice location, super close to the metro station (get city mapper if you‚Äôre planning on using the metro in paris, it‚Äôs dumb stupid easy) and to a bunch of good restaurants."
"Do not stay here! The building is under construction, it is dirty, and there are loud builders every morning. The apartment is dirty, and does not look the way it‚Äôs supposed to in the picture. The furniture is falling apart and there‚Äôs holes in the walls. The bed is so uncomfortable. I couldn‚Äôt sleep for a week. There were dirty panties in the closet and had a mouse infestation. the apartment smells like a public washroom! Do not stay here."
"Close to train station and restaurants, WiFi, pastries included. But it is more for older people that will be in bed early. If you plan to go out and come back after midnight, noise from phone calls are not tolerated. I had to cancel and seek other place to stay for I had plans to stay late every day. So it was not good for me nor the host."
"Farahs apartment exceeded so many of our expectations. Check in was a pleasure as we were given the opportunity to drop our bags to the apartment earlier due to our travel times. The proximity to the metro station makes visiting the sites a breeze but also, the modern, cosy feel of the apartment is evident as soon as you set foot in the door and is something you'll be excited to return home to. The apartment was just as much a part of our experience as the culture. There is no doubt in my mind that when I return to Paris I will stay at this airbnb again."
"This place is amazing! The location could not be better. It is a short walk (maybe 5-10 minutes, at most) to the Eiffel Tower and a short walk to the Arc de Triomphe de l'√âtoile. We waled to the Eiffel Tower just about every night. It is also a half a block to the train station. The apartment was exactly as described. We really could not have asked for a better experience."
"Great location. Few mins away from an underground metro station and bus stop right in front of apartment which was amazing when we came home late from the Eiffel Tower one night. Lockbox was difficult to find as closet was a panel that you had to pull open from the wall. There is no elevator and there are many steps so for people who have limited mobility, this apartment is probably not for you since it was on the 2nd floor (technically 3rd since Ground floor counts as first). Many small shops and restaurants all around the building so that was a plus. Bathroom is a bit small. I‚Äôm a short person and I found it uncomfortable but I think that‚Äôs expected from Paris in general."
"This flat has two different sides. The first side, the actual flat, is amazing. The apartment was spacious, clean and terrifically located. We do not have a bad thing to say about the actual apartment. However, the other side is that the space is actually managed by a flat management company, which is where the problems started. First, for check-in, we were required to reserve a 50 euro private car to give us the keys and drive us the 5-minutes from the train station to the flat. Then the driver didn't even show-up! We had to take a taxi over to their offices on the other side of the river to get the keys, and then take another to get back to the flat. There was an attempt to compensate us by providing a car for our departure; however, there were problems there too. We had not received confirmation for the reserved car by the day before our flight, so I called in to check on the status. Of course, the person we spoke to said nothing had been served, so he reserved a car for us and sent us the confirmation. Except, in the confirmation, we were told we would have to pay that driver 80 euros for the ride! I called back to try to get the mistake corrected, but of course the person who answered the phone didn't know what was going on. He said he would look into it and get back to me in 15-minutes. 2-hours later after no response, I called back to cancel the car. It was too much hassle, and I didn't want to deal with a missed flight because I couldn't trust the pick-up. That should have been the end, except 6-hours later after we had turned off our phones, they apparently called and left a voicemail telling us that the car was coming for us anyway! We didn't use the car. Now, I'm sure not everyone has this experience with them, but dealing with all of this ate up hours of our vacation and added a lot of stress which we did not need. Book at your own risk."
"It was a pleasant stay. The room was as described and the metro station was only a few minutes away. The flat had everything we needed, except for utensils but that was not expected. Overall good place & price. "
Can't review listing as host communicated a day before that due to a leak the listing wasn't ready. instead he switched me to his apartment which was nearby and larger. Area is very good for getting around Paris as it is 5 min walk from Les Hallea station. Walkable to the Louvre in 10 to 15 minutes. Plenty of restaurants and cafes (it's Paris) in rhe area
"The apartment is really small as described, but enough for a couple. The street outside is full with restaurants and people, but we heard almost no noise in the flat. Louvre and several other famous places are in walking distance, but metro stations are also close if you want to discover other parts of the city."
"Antoine‚Äôs place was close to the canal and the subway station. His apartment is spacious, however it isn‚Äôt as clean. It was dusty and the floor was sticky. The paint from the walls were pealing off and the chairs were uncomfortable to sit. The worst was that there was no sink in the washroom and the only bathroom sink was beside the shower in the bedroom. The only sink that was close to the washroom was the kitchen sink and we had to wash our hands in there after going to the bathroom. There was no dishwasher soap and the sponge that was left for us to use to wash the dishes was so old and gross. Overall, this wasn‚Äôt worth the rate we paid and since it was a last minute booking we didn‚Äôt have a choice."
"The space was good, close to the train station! However it feels much smaller in person than from the pictures! Also considering the high price I was expecting to have atleast shower gel and shampoo, but there was non (only some travel size leftovers from other guests) I paid 157‚Ç¨ for a nigh and unfortunatley it was not worth the money!"
If you are a light sleeper or not an early riser this may not be the best spot. You do hear foot noise from the unit upstairs and there is a passage for cars in the center of where apartment is. It worked out fine for the couple of days we were there. Metro station not too far away.
Place was closed to several train station/store/laundromat within walking distance. Communication was quick and fast. Only bad part was that the property was located on the 5th floor so there was a lot of walking up the stair no elevator. Otherwise it was a good location for it value
"Communication was excellent. The accomodation is in a convenient spot close to metro and train stations and quiet. The apartment is small, but has all you need although the bed is a double and  not so good if you are tall and not much room for two suitcases."
"ATTENTION! The owner of the apartment can not be reached at the mobile number, it turned out that the apartment is rented by the agency. Our plane was at 11:00 pm, we asked the owner to meet us with the keys around midnight in the apartment, but we were refused in categorical form. Instead of a friendly reception of guests we were offered to rent a hotel room and settle in the apartment in the morning (by the way, we were not offered to return money for a night not spent in the apartment). MINUSES: - The apartment is fully furnished IKEA; - A large number of junk from IKEA, in the kitchen, in the bathroom - the lack of free space for their own supplies; - DIRTY REFRIGERATOR; - Dirty dishes in cupboards (frying pans, plates, kitchen accessories), dirty (oily) cupboards, a lot of dust inside; - Dirty tiles in the bathroom (stains), hair and dirt in the cupboard under the sink, a lot of dust on the interior items in the bathroom; - In the presence of a dishwasher, washing machine - the absence of at least a few capsules for the dishwasher, a little washing powder for the washing machine - it seems that this was done specially so that the guests could buy and leave themselves in the apartment; - BAD SANITATION - on the last day the toilet bowl was clogged and did not lower anything (we are civilized people, none of us dropped any extraneous supplies into the toilet); - We did not prepare a third berth about which was agreed in advance (we hardly found a blanket and bed-clothes); - The apartment was badly cleaned for occupancy; - There is only one room in the apartment - a closed bedroom, the rest of the rooms are communicating, which can cause inconveniences; - THE APARTMENT WAS BADLY CLEANED FOR OCCUPANCY; - Refusal of the owner to go to a meeting and provide late check-out for at least a couple of hours; DEPARTURE IS STRICTLY UNTIL 11:00. PROS: - A good location - near the metro station, supermarkets, a bench with fresh vegetables and fruits, which works even on Sunday.

"Overall stay in these apartments were okay. The location is spot on, close to metro stations either side for quick access to the sights of Paris.  Apartment is very spacious with a balcony too which was good with a nice garden view.  A couple of things that let this place down one of which was the instructions to access the building. The text and code to go pick the keys up was helpful but after that there wasn‚Äôt anything and although there is some pictures on the page about accessing the building it would be good to include further instructions after picking up the key.  Secondly the noise. During the stay it wasn‚Äôt mentioned that there would be building works happening in the apartments above and this was unbearable during the early hours of the morning to the point of walls shaking. It kind of ruined it for the group to be awoken so brutally so it would be helpful to mention this for any future building works happening when guests are staying."
"Please note, the check-in is not until after 3pm! We asked the host for an earlier check-in or luggage drop off and this was not possible. It was kind a bummer since we planned to do things in the city during the day. Locker rental was 10‚Ç¨ each at train station. Apt was clean and nice. Seemed remodeled.  Bed was comfortable and there were amenities in the bathroom. Tons of extra pillows and blankets.  The only issues were that the power to the whole space went out several times when two kitchen appliances were running at the same time. The other issue was that (to no fault of the host) that there was a ton of noise in the stairwell for quite some time late at night...  Very loud and disruptive of sleep.  there were a lot of restaurants and bars around and it was really close to a train stop.  Also, this is on the top floor (fourth I think) with a very precarious winding staircase and no elevator. If you are not able to do stairs or have a lot of luggage, this would be a disaster."
"We had a lovely time in Paris. The location is great, close to all attractions and only 1 min to Metro station. Loads of pubs and restaurants around, also local shops for essential shopping. Communication also top class with the host. The flat is spacious, but there is a problem to use both living room sofas at the same time due lack of room to open for sleeping. Only one problem we have noticed that there was loads of dust everywhere and ants keep crossing through the rooms."
"easy to find it. very good location, close to metro station, restaurants, bars. good communication with the host. the only negative is the cleaning, wasn't very clean. towels and sheets didn't smell fresh and didn't seem clean"
"This place is so cute and cozy. A very unique place to stay with lots to eat and see nearby. Several markets, pharmacies, cafes and butchers on every block. A short walk to Sacre-Coeur, up a some small hills but we did it no problem with kids in tow. Very close to both Paris Est and Paris Nord train stations made access a breeze. Would stay here again!"
"The view from the apartment is nice and it is easy to reach the most areas in Paris, as the apartment is closed to a central Metro station. The cell phone and the two cards for the Paris cycling system are a very nice offer from Olivier's side which we really appreciated. Although we never met him, he is a good host. Whereas the apartment is very new and recently renovated, the rest of the building is quite old and a little bit ugly (staircase, elevator, etc.). During our stay, we were surprised by some works at the water system of the building. In both days we hadn't water during many hours and even when the water returned we had no warm water. This was really uncomfortable. Furthermore I have to say that the bathroom wasn't cleaned before our arrival (shower, lavatory). This also was a little bit uncomfortable.  When we had water to take a shower, the problem was that the water did not drain of from the shower because the sewer was very dirty and nearly congested. This made taking a shower really complicated and inconvenient."
"The flat location is good. Close to metro station. There is just in front of the flat a supermarkt that you can find everythings.  There are 2 double bad and one sofa bad. 4-5 people stay properly. We saw the owner of the flat ""Richard"" 2 times. Firdt day to have the keys a nd last day to give the keys back. There is just one thing that I have to say that the flat is not too much clean in my standart..."
"The room is too small, but it was ok for one night. The area is not the best, but at least it has a metro station on the corner"
"HORRENDOUS EXPERIENCE  A trip to Paris to celebrate our daughter‚Äôs 18th birthday. Everything planned, our air bnb apartment booked weeks in advance. As our train pulled into Paris we received an email saying that the host had cancelled our trip. We were absolutely devastated and panicked, sitting at the station with our suitcases and 2 daughters and no where to stay. Apparently the property was being listed and managed by one person but the host booked it out separately. This, of course, is COMPLETELY unacceptable, I would suggest never dealing with this host or staying at this property and whilst some support was available from Air bnb we were unable to secure alternative accommodation at such short notice, we will be seeking compensation, a horrendous experience and one I never want to go through again."
"Nice apartment and very well located. The apartment in general was very clean, but the the mattress pad and the pillow cover had hairs on them, which showed they were not washed before our arrival. This was very unfortunate given the bed bugs infestation in Paris, which requires more attention to both the mattress and the pillows. Also, the host left her/his clothes drying on a rack in the bedroom, which was not nice."
Nice appartment with 2 metro stations nearby. Veronica responds quickly via the airbnb app. Not the best neighbourhood though.
"The apartment location is optimal. In front of a bus stop, 50 meters away from the metro stop (warning: the deepest station in Paris, take the stairs there at your own risk), 5 minutes walking from Moulin Rouge and 20 minutes by public transport to the city center. The zone has plenty of stores, restaurants, caf√©s, bakeries, etc. The apartment is small, as shown in the ad, but cozy. Tony always answered our messages fast. We had some problems with the wifi but was solved quickly."
"It is a small but tastefully decorated apartment. Perfect for a couple of travelers and although it has space to accommodate up to 6 people, the kitchen is very small for everyone to eat there at the same time, we were 3 and it was a bit complicated to accommodate ourselves at such a small table. The sofa beds were uncomfortable for us to sleep on. Everything inside the building is fine but outside despite being safe, the course is not pretty. The good thing is that the metro station is a block and a half away and the Gare du Nord is 10 minutes away walking. It has the basic things necessary for bed, bathroom and kitchen."
"The location is really nice near the Lyon station. But since it is really a big station, I get off at a totally wrong exit and waste a lot time on looking for the place at first. Thierry is especially kindhearted to pick me up from the building gate. Everything is equipped with the house and there is a great hamburger restaurant just at downstairs of the building."
"PRO Location: wonderful, close to 2 metro stations, in 20 min you are everywhere. Superbe Host: the host is a very relaxed and easy going guy. Was ok and very open for late check in. Room: more little than expected but is not a problem for me, comfortable beds CONS Keys: we were two people, we asked for two keys, he didnt provide them saying that "" previous guest they lost the other bunch of keys"": sorry is not my problem. Room: dark, dark, dark. There is not a central light point bust just three lamps with very weak bulbs.  Toilet: the worst point of the apartment. Very low ceiling (we had to take shower lowering our head not to crash in the ceiling). The shower is tiny if you are tall is not for you, furthermore no basket or shelve to put shower cream or soap.....result soap and shower cream on the floor and bending to collect them was a mess, given the dimension of the shower) Toilet very dark. Weak bulbs Suggestion: with little improvement can be a nice apartment"
"In a nice area although inside the building things look kind of vintage and plain; the heating isn't powerful enough so it can be a bit cold during the night in the winter and the bathroom is outside the room so be prepared for a bit of wind; facilities are a bit vintage, pillowcase feels a bit rough, kitchen and your daily washing basin are combined, although no stove in the kitchen; maybe these are expected at this price in Paris, I'm not sure. Overall, great location, close to the metro station and quick to get to central Paris."
"House Ok. With kitchen etc as mentioned. But not suitable for 3 person if you with luggages. We have limited space of moving when we opened our luggage. Toilet clean but no curtain. For us, we need curtain to cover the window. We do ask for fan and iron as this weather too hot. We feel so stuffy in the house with no other ventilation except window. Owner just reply not provided as mentioned. We wear our crumpled clothes for the entire 5days in Paris. I hope some consideration will do. Not a good experienced of staying. But location near to train station. And a lots of restaurant nearby. Ohh btw no wifi provided. We lost communications with everyone. Need to find a restaurant to connect wifi. üòï"
"The apartment looks as described. Everything was ok except two problems at home. Firstly; there is a problem with hot water,  I guess it comes from a tank and it is not enough for 3 people to take shower in a day. Only one or two people can take a shower per day. After that you have only cold water and you have to wait for the next day. And Cecile didn't inform us about that before. Secondly, all sinks at home was blocked: Sink in bathroom, sink in the bath and sink in the kitchen... You have to wait 5-10 min after someone uses it and it is annoying sometimes.  We said these problems to Cecile in our first day, but she didn't provide any solution.  Except these problems everything was nice. Location is not very good for touristic attractions, but it is close to metro stations to reach them. We haven't met with Cecile directly, but except the problems above everything was smooth. "
"Me and my friend stayed in Antoine's apartment 13 days. We already knew the neighborhood, so we didn't be surprised. Even it might look dangerous it wasn't. The location of the apartment is great, very close to several metro stations, markets, cafes at Saint-Martin, etc. The building was clean, new and the caretaker was very polite and helpful. The apartment mostly fulfilled our expectations and needs, although it was full of Antoine's stuff and it was difficult for two women to settle in limited spare space. We had two problems, first was a canalization's smell from bathroom, which appeared after the rain or sometimes in the evening. We dealt with this keeping windows open during the entire day, and it worked. The second problem is uncomfortable bad. In fact, the flat doesn't have regular bad, but mattress put on the pallets. This was too, too uncomfortable and painful for sleeping, but the advantage is that couch it can be used for sleeping. Antoine was always available and very forthcoming to answer to all our issues and questions."
"The host was very welcoming and met us at the apartment after we followed his very accurate directions. The main feature of this place was the location as it was a 5 minute walk to the eiffel tower, whilst also being withing walking distance in the opposite direction to the champs-elysses, and within a 5 minute walk of the nearest metro station also.   The apartment itself was clean but also quite small. The loft (where one double-bed is situated) has a very low ceiling so not great for tall people, plus the stairs leading up to it are very narrow. Unfortunately the only bathroom is upstairs so you will have a challenge if you need to go during the night."
Very clean and cozy apartment near the Metro station. Tarek answerd quickly if we had questions and the Check-in was very easy too. At night it‚Äòs a bit noisy because of the street but it didn‚Äòt really bother us.
"Iris is a friendly person. She kindly arranged for the keys to be waiting for us at the apartment when we arrived as she couldn't be there herself.  On the positive side, the apartment is well located near the Alesia underground station. There are shops around the corner for groceries and the apartment is furnished with most basic utensils for cooking. There were however a number of problems with the apartment that lead us to leave an overall negative review: - By far the biggest issue was the intermittent (i.e. several hours to 1/2 day in the row) lack of warm water. We tried to call Iris about this upon noticing the problem the day after our arrival and left 2 voicemails but she didn't get back to  us. Fortunately there were no more disruptions on the 3rd and 4th day. There were also several small problems that annoyed us, even through we are quite laid back people:  - There were no instructions about the apartment to be found when we arrived. How to connect to Internet for instance. Eventually Iris texted us the instructions but we also later found them in one of the drawers in the kitchen. Would have made more sense to just leave them out so we found them upon arrival.  - The filter hadn't been removed from the coffee machine from the last utilisation and it was seriously mouldy and smelly - Although there is a TV, stereo and DVD player, there were no or not enough batteries in any of the remote controls, making the DVD player unusable. - The washing machine wasn't working All things considered, we still had a pleasant stay despite these issues.but would hesitate to recommend the place to friends. "
"The hotel is located close to the train station Paris Est. We slept one night and it was bad. The bedroom is very small. We could heart people talking next to our room, heart every 3 minutes someone flashing the toilet. The furniture is worn. The only good thing is the bed. The hotel is overpriced and the neighborhood is loud."
"The apartment is very well located, with two metro stations very close. It‚Äôs also a good position for nightlife with a lot of restaurants and cafes (Rue Oberkampf). The apartment was cozy, perfect for one person, but little dirty (the mirror was full of marks and the towels didn't smell good) and the WiFi stopped working the last two days."
"This apartment was absolutely beautiful, it was a bummer that we only stayed one night! It isn't in the best location for proximity to tourist sites, but it was very close to metro stations, including ones that go to the airport."
"Great location, 2 minutes from Voluntaires metro station which is very convenient, all main tourist attractions are around a 30 minute walk, supermarket and bakery right on your doorstep.....perfect!  The address given on booking is not the address of the apartment, it‚Äôs across the road. The apartment was as described, small but cosy, however the sofa bed was very uncomfortable and noisy at the slightest of movement, the pillows were also very thin, there was only 2 towels provided and a small hair towel, we were there for 5 days, there was only one toilet roll and one dish towel which was dirty.  We had a great time in Paris and the above did not spoil it, just some feedback for the host."
Very close to the train station and lots of restaurants and hop on hop off buses. Lots of undesirables in the neighborhood being close to the train station. No problems experienced.  Hotel room was on the fifth floor and was very quiet at night. Nice fast elevator. 
"Apartment was perfect, smooth check-in and checkout. Neighbourhood is not the best, very dirty. The place is very close to Metro station so you won't get in any trouble even at night."
"The studio is optimally placed, in a nice neighborhood and very close to the metro and the train stations. We found it clean and tidy.  Beware of a few things, though: - there may be some noise in early morning (probably coming from other apartments in the building ‚Äì some construction or manual work I'd say) - the bathroom is clean but the shower drain smells bad, so remember to keep the door closed at night or when you leave. This needs to be fixed as we are not the first noticing! Also, the sink is not easily accessible if you are taller than 1.75 as you'd easily bang your head on the hanging boiler. - the kitchen has many things you may need to cook a quick meal, but there's only one chair and no table whatsoever, so enjoy your standing dinner (this is also why we didn't use it). They charge an extra ~‚Ç¨50 for early (before 4pm) check-in, but if you really need wait until the very end and they'll cut the price significantly!"
"caroline‚Äôs house is near the subway station and bua stop. especially the bus stop(bus number 96) is very close to house. so i can go le marais easily and quickly. i was worried about bed bug but caroline‚Äôs house has no bed bug! so i could stay well and she is quick in response so if you have a question, we could have message quickly!"
"The good things is that the location is alright, there is a nearby metro station and bus stop and there is a good amount of restaurants and fast food options nearby. Although unfortunately, it is quite unhygienic,  there is a bad smell, it is quite noisy and there is no parking."
Lots of room for 6 people. Bathroom has 3 sinks which made it no problem for 6 people to get ready in the morning or before going out. Very close and convenient to Charles de Gaulle metro station which gets you to many lines in the city and a direct line to the Palace of Versailles.
"This place is awesome! Both my sister and I stayed here for our stay in Paris. The place is nicely decorated, kept clean daily, and comes fully equipped - your own mini fridge, towels, rice cooker, fully equipped kitchen, laundry machine, etc. While the nearby Monoprix had closed down, there was a Simply grocery store just across the road that we could still make use of. It is about 10 min walk from RER stations (a fancier train), and just across the road from the nearest Metro station - line 7. One thing I'd comment on is the metro station. Line 7 is frequented by pocket thieves. My sister and I both had our phones stolen on Line 7 on our first days here, coming up to the area. While I had been unable to follow the thief due to the heavy luggage I had with me, my sister was punched in the face and the thief was out the door as the train doors closed, which meant we were stuck inside and unable to do anything about it. While we still enjoyed the rest of our trips, we were careful not to use the metro line if we could avoid it - hence the RER stations. I'd keep this in mind while travelling to and from this place via public transit."
"BRUTAL BREAK IN AND STOLEN PERSONAL PROPERTY! Antonie, Amp and Julie have not willing to help with any part of the break in! They have been ignoring my messages to resolve the theft of property for 10 days after promising they would help.               We returned from a day in Paris to find the door literally kicked off the hinges, laying on the floor. The building front has a code, second door a key and yet the apartment door was destroyed. I now believe the thieves LIVE in the building as our apartment door was the only one damaged. Also, my ipad still shows it's location in the building! Antonie, Amp and Julie don't seem to care!         We were afraid for our safety, afraid to entry the apartment.      After the police came, we took stock of stolen property including passports, ipads, jewelry, sunglasses, etc with a total value of $4000....all gone! We had to go to the police station to file a report. When trying to find a new place to stay our last night, Antonie, Amp and Julie did nothing but were obsessed with the apartment, their insurance claim but didn't have time for us. I have been trying to contact Antonie, Amp and Julie through Airbnb message and by phone but no response.  They are required to carry insurance for stolen property but these three won't provide any process to make a claim, neither will Airbnb. DON'T STAY WITH PEOPLE WHO ONLY WANT YOUR MONEY, WHO ONLY DON""T HAVE TIME TO HELP!            DON'T STAY HERE!  Antonie.........Amp.........Julie, live up to your responsibility to your guests!  Do what's right, what's moral!"
"in picked up the keys. The first night we slept there one of us noticed that the sheets had brown stains and 2 of us had been bitten. They brought new sheets however, one of us continued to experience bites. We assumed there must be a mosquito in the house and didn‚Äôt mention anything to the owner. But upon inspection of the bed we found multiple bed bugs, mature ones and baby bed bugs. We promptly messaged the owners agency and they informed us that the problem was our fault and insisted we go purchase the necessary products to exterminate their facility. On top of these unacceptable issues we also got locked in a room for 12hrs due to the lock on the bedroom door falling apart. The apartment smelled of mildew and the towels were dirty. The part that was really disappointing however, was the host not taking responsibility for the infestation clearly present. Aside from all the incidents the staff was very amicable and the location is great."
"The good:  - good location, close to multiple metro stations to get anywhere in paris, and the neighbourhood itself was great with lots of restaurants, cafes, shops, etc.  - self-check in is very convenient and easy - the place is very small but functional, good value for the neighbourhood  The bad:  - the bed was very uncomfortable. it's very uneven and the pillows are not supportive, so if you have neck and back troubles like I do, you will probably wake up in pain every morning - the HEAT. if you go in the summer, and it's supposed to be 30+ degrees, I would not recommend staying here. the place is tiny with no cross ventilation, on the 5th floor, and only 1 small window that doesn't have a screen (so mosquitos got in). it was so hot at night that i actually couldn't sleep without taking an ice cold shower first and even then I was sweating. This would be a great place to stay when it's a little bit cooler out, but I wouldn't recommend it for July/August.  "
"We stayed at Alexis place for a week and our first impression of the apartment was that it needed major work. The housekeeper didn't do a good job at cleaning the flat  before our arrival and I had to clean the apartment and re wash the towels and linens before we used them. Alexis did offer to send in the housekeeper a day after but I had already picked up.  The shower curtain is loose and the shower head is broken-  it almost hit me in the head while I was taking a shower, also the mirror in the bathroom is broken as well.  The carpet in the living room is dirty and the apartment in general Is rusty. The good thing about this apartment is the location which is great! The metro station is literally 5 steps away from the building and it is located in a safe neighborhood, also the bed is comfortable and Alexis was fast with communication."
"Location! Just in front of the train station, lot of restaurants around the hotel, and there's always a person in the front desk to help you. The only bad aspect is the homeless people leaving around this area, at night it could be a little scary. However, I would recommend staying here."
"Danielle's studio is an ideal location for access to The Louvre, Ille de la Cite & beyond which are easily within walking distance. There is a metro station (Etienne Marcel) around the corner. The nearby streets have plenty of cafes, brasseries, bakeries, delis etc. The only problem we had was noise from the streets below at night. Otherwise no complaints; Danielle was in attendance on our arrival & was readily available for advice during our stay.  Enjoy!"
"The closest metro station to this apartment is Maison Blanche. The apartment was fine, instructions and check in process was satisfactory. However, the check out process was appalling. The host asked me what time I wished to check out. I said 3pm. At 2pm I recieve a message saying ""Hi, time to check out"". I replied asking if we could check out as planned at 3pm and there was no reply. In fact, we got back to the apartment and found a random cleaner already in the apartment with full access to all of our belongings. This was a serious violation. The check out process and the minimal communication completely ruined our experience."
"Overall, we had a wonderful stay at the unit as described and seen in the photos. The location was also favourable as it was walkable from the metro stations, and the neighbourhood nearby had lots to explore. We did however struggle with the lock each time to get in the unit, which was rather frustrating."
"I chose this house because it was on ground floor so I wouldn't have to lift  my heavy baggage up many floors (since many houses in Paris don't have elevators). The house is 5 minutes away from a bus stop and about 10-15 from the nearest metro station. On Saturday night I enjoyed a group of musicians playing all together on the square of the metro station which was really cool. The neighbourhood is full of kids so the noise could be a slight problem if you are into silence-since the window must stay open 24/7.  The house is really small (which is obvious since it's a ""studette""). On every single piece of the house you will find stickers with instructions (such as ""close the door of the fridge with force"") which is convenient if you have questions  and the host had sent me ALL those information in a long email about a week before arrival. She also asked if I needed towels and bed sheets for 20‚Ç¨ extra and I refused (even though I found all those in the house, I didn't use them). A few hours before my arrival she also notified me of a new incident: a couple of broken bricks in the shower. So far so good... But the house suffers from humidity problems: the wall behind the towels  (the spot isn't shown in the photos) had a large mark because of it and between the bricks on the shower you can see too many black marks because of humidity. So that made the atmosphere unbearable. The odour was really bad and I wanted to leave the house from the first moment, but had no choise other than be patient until my departure. So all I did was spending the least amount of time in (just sleeping and taking a quick shower - during which the odour became truly unbearable) and go out in the city. When I used the kitchen tap the odour coming from the sink was even worse.  So, all that deteriorated my staying in Paris since I was waiting for a more decent house. I still wonder why nobody has ever mentioned that, since it's a problem that can even cause health issues (especially respiratory). The host was kind to ask me about my experience after leaving and answered that she's sorry about that and that a renovation is to be done during summer. Also arrival and leaving times were really flexible."
"Yas was very nice, and we could leave our luggage in the apartment even before check-in as she hadn‚Äôt finished cleaning. When we returned, however, the flat was not clean. Especially the rugs etc looked like they hadn‚Äôt been washed for a while, so did the steep staircase. The flat extremely tiny and carelessly put together (e.g., all cleaning equipment etc standing around). We could not stand straight in the shower. Also, it smelled like chlorine which didn‚Äôt disappear after opening the windows for a while. The flat is underneath a staircase on the ground floor so it is very loud. The bed is very hard, but large enough for two people.  Overall, it is an ok place to stay close to two major train stations in Paris for a night, but sadly not more."
"This loft is ideally situated close to the Marais and within walking distance to the R√©publique metro station so it's a great place to explore Paris from.   As is often the case with professional hosts, it does not feel like the place has been lived in so can be a bit soul-less. Not a major problem for us as we were only staying for one night.   Overall we had a good stay in this apartment but a few glitches dragged the global rating of the place down :   - The apartment wasn't ready for the check in time so we were made to wait while it was cleaned.  This was frustrating as it was raining and we were traveling with children. - The beds weren't made and were missing some sheets.  - The provided bathroom towels were absolutely tiny. - The TV in the downstairs bedroom seems like a strange choice.   I would consider staying here again but probably just on my own or as a couple. Given the size of the bathroom I wouldn't recommend staying here with more than 4 people. "
"In a busy neighbourhood with good food shops and caf√©s. Metro stations just a few minutes away. Lacking comfort (which made us disinclined to spend much time there, defeating the point of staying in an apartment): sofa quite narrow and hard, no proper dining facilities (just a low coffee table, the sofa, wicker armchair) which dissuaded us from cooking a full meal, no extra pillows provided (just one per person), bedlinen clean but worn, not enough towels for 2 people for 3 nights (one tiny handtowel, two mismatched bathtowels). No instructions on how to operate TV or heating, but Anne replied very quickly to queries.¬†"
The apartment is small - very small - that was expected so this is more a statement than a complaint. The description of the apartment is accurate. What is leaves out is that the street below is very noisy - i am a deep sleeper and it bothered me for the entirety of the week i was there. I had requested to check in early - which was not possible but they do have an arrangement for me to leave my bags; this was convenient. Communication was a challenge through & through. The internet did not work at the apartment for the first three days i was there. For large parts there was no response from Yoni. I was there towards the end of my trip so not having internet was very very challenging for me. Now having read some of the older reviews - i think this is a consistent issue. There are no hangers provided - i requested for some - which again was unanswered. The metro station is very close by - the neighbourhood itself i will avoid in future. Just did not feel very safe to me.
"Clair was a friendly and responsive host. The apartment is small but in a very good location, close to the metro station with plenty of restaurants and shops downstairs. The room was quiet as it was further back in the complex. However, walking on the street may feel unsafe at night if travelling alone.  This apartment might suit a young individual traveller who doesn‚Äôt mind staying on a bustling street with nightlife. Things to note:  The apartment is on the 4th floor with small winding steps and there isn‚Äôt a lift so it may be difficult for those with bulky luggage. Although there is a washing machine, our clothes weren‚Äôt able to dry and needed to be rewashed somewhere else.  As a couple, we found the bed to be quite narrow and our feet dangled off the end (despite us not being very tall). It was also quite hard which made it difficult to sleep."
"Basic but comfortable room for a stopover in Paris near Gard du Nord station. Earplugs were provided as it is quite noisy (room overlooked the station and train tracks). Room was clean and the mattress pretty comfortable. Main gripe is that initially, I accidentally booked the wrong date and when I tried to change them they refused. After a lot of long winded, frustrating correspondence with Airbnb support (who were great) the hotel agreed to change the dates but charged an extra ¬£50. Really annoying but it was that or lose the whole cost of the booking. Pretty stingy."
"3 of us stayed for 2 nights (9/22-24/2023). The location of the house was near Metro station and convenient. However, there was construction going on during our stay and the workers were working right by the windows and we didn't feel comfortable at all.  We put the metal blinds and curtains down during the stay and it was annoying that we couldn't leave the windows open. The workers were working on Friday and Saturday. We could hear them talking and construction noise even with the windows closed.  If I had known there was constructions  at the building, I would have booked else where.  Check with the owner if you are booking anytime near this month or next month.  It seemed like the construction would finish anytime soon though."
"Small apartment in the outskirts of Paris. Easy 10min walk to nearest metro station to get to Paris center. Private parking garage is a plus. The apartment itself is small and simple. Very quiet neighborhood.  Only complains: temperature was way too low, heaters haven‚Äôt been used in a while + bedsheets would need an upgrade. Host is very quick to respond but not flexible at all when it comes to check-in and out, which was disappointing."
Camille cancelled our booking past midnight the day of our booking. She was offended that I asked for 12pm check in or bag drop when her listing clearly states 12pm check in. She did not like me asking for this. She was incredibly rude and unkind to someone visiting and asking a very valid question arriving all the way from Australia. Cancelling our booking leaving us little time to find other accommodation. She stated I am not a hotel and I don‚Äôt like the way you are communicating with me. All I did was ask why we can‚Äôt when you have 12pm check in which we were relying on. If not ok just say you definitely cannot accommodate this time and to use baggage lockers at the train station. Suggest not to book here as believe she may be quite rude and unreliable and cannot be a warm host to tourists.
"+ Small (but big enough) apartment + Very close to the metro station (Max Dormoy) - The duvet however is way too small for the bed. If you sleep in the bed with 2 people, the duvet will not fit at all. There is no extra blanket to make sure that the other person is covered.  +/- Neighbourhood is not the best, but acceptable + Flexible & quick responding host."
"Lydia is really nice person. Whenever we got problem, she replied our messages within 15 mins. And her friends are on time to see us so that we had no worry to check-in and out. The room is cozy but there are no problem with staying for two persons. The neighborhood is very safe for women even at night and just a min from the closest station. And also monoprix, which is a supermarket, is on just across the street."
"Convenient located apartment, close to the main train stations.  Ideal for families. The only disadvantage is the restaurant downstairs, the noise makes you keep the windows closed at night."
Very conveniently located near the underground but far away from the bus station to Effeil Towel. The check in time is not flexible because Beatrice entrusted an Airbnb company to operate this house. We waited for almost 2 hours for the staff from that company to send the key and introduce the house for only 2 minutes. I suggest that they can offer a lock box to put the key in because they are always busy. The bedroom and refrigerator were a little bit dirty. But it doesn‚Äôt matter for just putting some water on that refrigerator. The house is not as bright as the picture shows. The floor is too old that makes a lot of noise when someone is walking on that in the morning.
"In general the apartment was OK but a lot of things were just old, a little dirty, broken or just not there. The sofa was very uncomfortable for two adults, there were stains on the couch and the bed covers were fresh but very old. The cattle was broken, knifes were blunt, no basic cooking equipment, only salt, drawers were dirty, there was no hair dryer and no air conditioning as described on air bnb. Of course we can live without these things and were not expecting luxury but then the price has to be different or at least the description needs to be honest. Best part: there is a bar next door, small shops and the metro station to get around easily."
"Pros: * many bathrooms * clean linens and sheets * spacious living room * very close to two metro stations Cons: * no air conditioning which meant we had to keep the windows open. Because there was a bar next door, there was a lot of loud noise that could be heard until 3AM, and because the windows had to stay open for air circulation, it was difficult to sleep until 3AM or 4AM every night. If the airbnb had any portable fans, we would've been able to keep the windows closed and it would've made our nights a lot better. *The street also had a lot of construction for the stores across the street and there were garbage compactors that came at 4 or 5AM and would wake us up every morning.  * not enough toilet paper or paper towels for staying there for 3 days. We had to go out and buy more toilet paper on our own."
"Even though we read plenty of good reviews of the place, unfortunately our stay was not a smooth one.. We booked the place a few months before the trip. As a routine, I started contacting the host about 10 days before the trip for more details on check-in process. But this time there was no response (either airbnb messages or text messages). No response for a whole week. With 3 days left, we were a little freaked out because we have a large group (6 adults with 4 elderly) arriving in the evening. It would be a nightmare if we had to wander the street for a hotel to stay. We had airbnb customer support contact the host. When they couldn't reach the host either, they canceled the reservation and offered a few alternatives. At that point, everything is either twice as expensive or very far away from the city.. Miraculously, two days before the trip, Fabien responded to our message. He apologized for not responding earlier and offered the place to us again. In the end we were able to still stay at this place, although it was a stressful few days.. Fabien's place is conveniently located near the train station and metro line, and there is a supermarket right around the corner. The place is clean, and has a small terrace, which is quite nice. We had a few of problems during the stay. First, hot water stopped working. The problem turns out to be a little electric switch keeps jumping. One just needs to find the switch (in the baby's room) and switch it back to on. After doing so it takes a couple of hours for the water to heat up. Second, the gas stove stopped working. It was due to the gas tank going empty. It worked fine after someone replaced it. Both problems are understandable, although they happened at the most inconvenient times (in the middle of shower/cooking). The real issue is that the turnaround time for a response is too long. The host lives in a different country, and hires someone else to manage the apartment, who has a rather busy job and can't always answer the phone (both times we had to try many times to reach her, usually after a hour or so). For non-French speakers, the person managing the apartment can sound really rude.. some are probably due to language barrier but some are just rude (eg, she hanged up on me twice..). My wife was a also little offended after speaking with her a few times. She is often too busy to come herself so she would send her sons to fix the problems (eg, replacing the gas tank). Finally, we lost a speaker while in there. It's not worth much, so I left it on the couch because I don't think anyone would take it. But after spending the day in Paris it's gone.. don't have any evidence or anything so we let it go. In the end..."
"The location is very good, close to metro station and Eiffel Tower. We were very disappointed in the cleanliness of this unit. Room had a strong smell of mold. The shower curtain and tile had black mold which we took pictures of and sent to GuestReady. Pillows were stained yellow and had to send pictures to get them replaced.  Very disappointed with the room compared to pictures and description."
"The greatest value for this place is its location. Very central and very close to the metro station, specifically, RER line B, which goes straight to CDG airport. It is literally ~50 meters from the metro exit to the entrance of the building.  The appartment is on the 5-th floor with no elevator and the stairway is a narrow spiral in an old building. Carring large luggages can be a challenge. The appartments is basic, but necessary things are there. The show cabin is tiny, large person may not fit.  At night it can be noisy, since the building is on a narrow but a busy street with multiple eateries at the ground level."
"the apartment is in the most perfect location, by the gardens in front of the Eiffel Tower. also right by a metro station which takes you everywhere you need to go for 1.90 (don't take taxis). however the apartment is on the sixth floor with twelve flights of stairs- no lift. my partner struggled himself, but I have ME so I had to have a nap everytime we got in because the stairs left me in pain & exhausted. it is lovely and clean. however, there was no oven and we had bought food to cook! "
"The apartment is located in a very nice area, 10 mins walk from La Tour Eiffel and 3 mins to the metro station. It was good size for a family of 2 adults and 3 kids.  We stayed in October and it was quite cold inside. The central heating didn‚Äôt help, there were no carpets on the floors even in the bathroom there was no mat to stand on the floor after a shower. There were a lot of personal belongings there. It felt like they just left the apartment, wardrobes in kids room were full of clothes and there was no where to store our belongings. There was unfinished sushi in the fridge, kitchen was well equipped but the cabinets inside were a mess and it was impossible to find anything. There was one roll of toilet paper (which wasn‚Äôt enough for 5 people), a small piece of soap and no shower gel. I would advise the host to pay some attention to this kind of things."
Great apartment for the few days we were there. Has everything you need. Close to Metro station.  Bath/ shower is quite small but that is the only negative of the place.
"Avoid Sweet Inn. I specifically asked if AC was present and was firmly reassured that it was. Miserable without AC on 90 degree+ days in a tenement style apartment with pock marked cement floors. Their solution to the AC was to bring a single worthless portable AC unit for a 4 BR apartment and then have the audacity to imply all must be fine now. What a bad joke. So most of our group stayed in a nearby hotel, while the remaining few endured torture from heat and mosquito infestation. We would have all moved, but for limited hotel availability for such a large group. I have used BNB in the past, but to save a few pennies...due to this experience...never again."
Wir hatten eine wundersch√∂ne Woche mit vielen Abenteuer. Wir konnten alles gut erreichen mit der Metro. Die Wohnung war voll ausgestatet und gem√ºtlich. Nous avons eu une jolie semaine avec beaucoup des aventures. Avec le metro nous avons eu le possibilit√© d‚Äòaller partout √† Paris. L‚Äòappartement avait tout que tu prends et c‚Äò√©tait tr√®s agr√©able. We had a beautiful week and a lot of adventures. You can arrive everything with the metrostation near the house. The appartement has everthing you need to live and is very comfotable.
"Overall, decent. Very close to the train stations, local restaurants, and convenience stores. Very small apartment, which seems to be accommodated when people are not renting. This did not give the ‚ÄúAirBnb‚Äù experience I have found else where. Again overall, decent but would not recommend. Granted I have stayed in countless Airbnbs."
The first floor that she said is the second floor. You must go up the stairs to go to her house. I had a 2 big luggage and she said she couldn't help me. I don't recommend it if you have a big luggage. And The subway station is also far away. I don‚Äôt know.
"The best about this rental is the location. You are right in the middle of the Latin quarter. Everything is within walking distance. There are restaurants right at the door! Metro and bus stations one or two short blocks away.  There is some noise at night but that is expected since you are in the middle of the action. My wife and kids had no trouble falling asleep so it was not an issue for us. Notre Dame is within walking distance. The Batobus stop is also very close. There are convenience stores nearby.  The host will ask you to make a deposit using a link. The link will ask you to take pictures of the items that are damaged otherwise they could asume you broke something and keep your money. When you upload the pictures make sure you use ‚Äúlighter files‚Äù otherwise pictures won‚Äôt upload. The host did not mention that there was a broken lamp and broken floor standing fan. Maybe they did not know about it. Anyway, communication was excellent and I was able to let them know about it."
"I would not recommend this place for 4 people to stay. Everything is really cramped and crumbled and the bathroom is really tiny. Most of the easily accessible doors, cupboards are locked which makes life so difficult to remove utensils from other doors on the side. The plugs near the coffee machine and fridge had to be taken out whenever we had to use other appliance. The table as well had a plastic film on which made it feel that the guests should not use the furniture. Also, the furniture is not of the best quality, the bed/ lattenpost literally made a loud noise in the middle of the night when my parents were sleeping. There is lot of personal stuff already in the apartment so for 4 people definitely its not the best. Also, the water heater didn‚Äôt work for the the 4th person to have a bath on our first day which was very frustrating. The apartment is quite nearby to Central station but the building is quite old and also loud."
"I stayed at Janis' home for a total of 12 days for my birthday, so I have an extensive review on my stay. I'll start with: ***PROS - The home is located in a quiet (SOMEtimes, check the cons,) secluded area off of the busy street - The home is very modern (beautiful shower, bathroom, fully fitted kitchen) and tastefully decorated - Janis was very responsive and empathetic when issues would arise - Located near a multitude of grocery stores, cafe's, restaurants, etc! Additionally, there's a market that happened every few days during my stay where I could buy fresh fruits, vegetables, trinkets, etc. - Near lots of public transportation! You have a metro station 2 minutes from the house, another 5 minutes, a bus stop located directly in front of the door, and a tram station 10 minutes away. This was so exceptionally convenient! During the strike, having so many options was a HUGE plus! ***CONS - The key to the home was very finicky. It made opening and locking the door exceptionally difficult, and I dreaded having to go back inside because of how difficult it was to open the door. - The home did have a lingering mildew-y smell to it upon entering for the first time. I did bring this up to Janis, whom of which was very responsive and sent over the cleaning girl. She gave me new sheets, but the smell persisted all 12 days. - There were no recommendations on things to do in the area, must-see restaurants, etc. Considering I was in town for my birthday, this would have made searching for something to do very easy. Additionally, I have never stayed in this district before, so I did not know which restaurants to try or stay away from. It was done mostly through trial and error. - The home could have been cleaner. There was dust on a lot of the surfaces, and of course, the mildew smell. I asked if the cleaning woman could come and clean the apartment and instead, I was just given new sheets which did not help much at all considering the smell came from the bathroom and kitchen as well. - No storage for my clothing. For 12 days, I remained grabbing things from my luggage which was a total hassle. If there was storage, there was no mention of it to me-- which brings me to my next con - No book of information on how to operate things in the home. I was only shown how to wash my clothing (there's no dryer, fyi) and that's it. I was not shown where dishes were, how to operate the lights (it's all touchscreen, but you can actually dim the lights and I did not know this!) I did not know what could and could not be used. It was frustrating. Also, there was a light that could be used to illuminate the stairway leading up to the home and I did not find this out until I was leaving the home to return back to America! This means, I was constantly using my phone's flashlight every time I came home at night, to illuminate my way to the home. Connecting to the wifi was annoying because the password is so incredibly long. There are codes to get to the home which was inconvenient because it was two sets of codes I had to remember. This did not prove useful when my phone died one night. A key fob to scan to get through would have been much more efficient. I'm not sure if he did not want to lend it to the guests, but I know they exist because I noticed some of the other residents in the area using them to get through. - The bed was so incredibly uncomfortable. My back was killing me almost every time I woke! In fact, there were several times I stayed at a friend's place to give myself a break. The bed is in a little ""cut out"" which was so surprisingly annoying to get in and out of because of the space in front of it. - Noise. In Paris, this is to be expected and this home was no exception. You can hear people walking up and down the stairs, you can hear conversations outside of the window. Again, this is nothing new in Paris. However, several mornings, there was constant knocking that would continue on for hours on end. Furthermore, someone in the area plays a saxophone for hours straight, and it could be heard very clearly. They stopped at night, but usually started early in the morning or afternoon. - This is personal preference, but the location was a bit far from everything I wanted to see and do. In the 13th arr. there really isn't much to see or do for the tourist. I always found myself at the metro, leaving this district to go to Bastille or Pigalle, or Republique for fun ""locals only"" things to do. ***CONCLUSION Overall, I do not think I would stay here again, so it pains me to say that I cannot recommend this home. I was given a discount for my birthday which was so incredibly kind of Janis to do, but I will always remain honest in my reviews. For the price paid (which would have obviously been more without the discount,) I hate to say that I truly believe I would have gotten a better value for my money elsewhere. Perhaps this home may be better suited for someone with a shorter stay, but anything longer than a week is questionable. This home is beautiful in its photos, but it missed out on a lot for the price."
"Beverly was good host. The layout of the house was an issue for us. Main living area was at the bottom of spiral stairs.  Stairs were unsafe.  Rails for stairs were not attached to wall, when you grab the rail it was loose. unsafe for people who are young or old. Masonry walls and ceiling have sand  that is constantly dropping everywhere. Sand in bed every day and anything that is left out. Wifi does  not work downstairs.  At night the were loud and unsafe  people talking outside the apartment.   Same trip we stayed in Airbnb in Lyon. House was bigger,  better and less expensive.  Beverly was very responsive to questions.  Location was close to metro station.  there was civil unrest,  manifestation during our stay, affected our plans, protesters were drunk and urinating in the streets in front of my kids, not host fault but planned riot by house did cause us to lose time during stay."
"The place was small but okay. Ana was not helpful with our doubts at all. In fact, when you asked her something she would get mad an say her house is high quality and that‚Äôs it. I don‚Äôt know about winter but in summer its really hot and there where bugs literally everywhere, like small flies that would go into your nose and ears and everything, it was horrible. The only good thing is that the apartment is near a metro station. Would not recommend."
"The area is not the best in Paris, but it is near bus and train stations and is easy to travel. But at night the area is not safe for walking."
"We were able to check in without anxiety because the host was quick to reply to the message, so we could ask questions easily from the ease of contact.  In addition, the house is close to the station with many cafes, and there is also supermarket, so no discomfort for meals. We stayed with 4 people, but we could use it extensively.  Shower was lukewarm water pressure was weak, but it was very clean."
"The apartment is very well located, the area surrounding it it‚Äôs full of restaurants, supermarkets and shops. Also, the metro & the bus stations are just few minutes away. The only negative note is that for  long stays it‚Äôs a bit uncomfortable as there isn‚Äôt an available wardrobe to hang the clothes on."
"The Good - Great location. It is in the center of Paris 2nd Arrondissement. Numerous metro stations nearby. There are several grocery stores, bakeries, cafes, bars, you name it, it is near. The apartment has Netflix and several television channels. Could not be more centrally located. Also, I was able to leave my luggage at the apartment before I checked in. That was really nice. The Not So Good ‚Äì The apartment is on the fourth floor (au troisi√®me √©tage) with a very narrow stairway and no elevator. I did not know that there was no elevator before renting the place because there were no other comments about this fact. It was a huge problem  for me at the beginning and at the end of my stay. After a long flight and after a long metro ride from the airport, it was very difficult to take my luggage up the narrow stairs. And at the end of my stay, it was very difficult for me to take my luggage down the three flights of stairs. If the lack of an elevator is no problem for you, you will really enjoy your stay at this place."
"We stayed 5 nights in the apartment. The location is pretty good: the Strasbourg Saint-Denis station is approax. 3 minutes distance, and there are a lot of patesseries, restaurants very close to the flat.  The flat is modern and clean, but honestly a lot of thing is missing: - There is no wardrobe in the flat and we had to keep our clothes in the suitcases - The equipment of the kitchen is very poor. We didn‚Äôt get any diswashing liquid - There is a Nespresso coffee machine, but there is no capsules, sugars, milk, etc‚Ä¶ (it would be only a small attention) - In the bathroom there is no shower gel and shampoo - In the living room the curtains are lights, and there is no shutter or black out curtains - The walls of the flat are very thins, it means you can hear everything from the neighbours, and from the streets and it is very difficult to sleep when you hear neigbourghs in the other room or the noises from the street, especially Friday‚Äôs and Saturday‚Äôs nights - There is no central heating, only an air condition, it is working well, but the outside temperature was only 10 degrees. In the bathroom there is an electric radiator, it is okay. - The communication was very official with the hosts. We didn‚Äôt get any flexibility regarding to the check-in and check-out. We got a very general recommendation about the sights, for instance: we must see the Eiffel Tower (Thanks, guys!!!:D), but nothing personal or special things."
"The basic needs of our multi-generational party of six were met. The location is great.  There is shopping closeby as well as subway stops.  The Denfert-Rochereau station is an easy walk away and it is both a M√©tro and RER station which offers direct links to the two major airports.  The neighborhood is very quiet.  The main room is open and airy. The washing machine was very useful, especially since some of us had already been traveling for two weeks. There were however some problems. We expected that there would be two toilets but one was broken and taped shut. Also, the multilevel space has several staircases and two are without railings. Two members of our group came very close to falling and a third did fall, requiring a trip to the emergency room and seven stitches to the head.  This listing is not safe for young children nor for persons with mobility issues. Also, in parts of the lower level one person who is six feet tall brushed his head on the ceilings. Both the WI-FI and electrical power tripped off once during the week. The WI-FI was reset quickly by turning its electrical systems off and back on. The electrical power too was reset once we phoned the owner who told us where to find the circuit breaker.  The owner was an effective, efficient contact.  Her mother was waiting for us with the keys when we arrived and came again just before we left so that we could return the keys.  Communication with her was in French."
Great to stay here. A small but cozy room in Paris. Close to the metro station thus making our visit to center area very very convenient.  Located on 4th floor so a bit difficult for large luggage to go through.  
"Was ok until the aircon broke on the first night. Host was all words, no action. Noisy location with window open. Check train station and hospital on map. After three nights of no sleep, we contacted Airbnb to get it resolved. Finally, the host said they would move us, so we discovered their lies about aircon in the building not working. Airbnb was great, and we got refunded an % so we could book somewhere else. Would never stay there again."
We had a lovely stay in Dominique‚Äôs apartment for three nights in Paris! The apartment was incredibly clean and had all the amenities we could need. The bed was also a lot more comfortable than we were expecting! Perfect for the two of us- the location was just right and within walking distance of two metro stations although we walked into the centre of Paris no problem within 20 minutes. There is no wifi but if you have mobile data that‚Äôs no problem as the signal is really good. The only thing I would say is that picking up the keys was slightly confusing but nothing that we couldn‚Äôt work out with a bit of google maps and asking around. Where you pick up the keys is only a 5 minute walk from the apartment which isn‚Äôt bad at all. Thank you very much Dominique!
"From my personal experience, it is not safe to stay in this apartment.  I was robbed inside this apartment building with which there are two gates with codes. Two robbers came down stairs when I was waiting for the lift. (The lift can only hold two people, so I let my parents go up first) At first, I thought they were residences in the building as it seems impossible for outsiders to come inside the building. So when they approached me to rob my phone and bag, I was shocked at first, then I started to struggle. I was dragged on the floor tightly holding my bag and phone, but they started to beat me. At last, two robbers grabbed my cell phone and backpack (inside which there is my other cell phone, Ipad wallet and so on), and ran out of the building. I called the police immediately, but no police showed up, so I had to go to the police station which is ten minutes away to report the case. Antoine came two hours later after my request. He let me use his cell phone to call the bank to block my credit cards. Further, there was nothing he could do, or advice he could give. I called airbnb service center, but no actual help they could offer.  I passed three sleepless nights there and I was quite sensitive at every soundÔºå as I was afraid that there would be robbers inside the building.  The apartment building is located close to the subway and it is convenient to go everywhere. The apartment is comparatively clean.  No stock of toilette paper, just half used roll in the toilette. To be honest, from what I have suffered in this apartment building, the location and cleanliness of the apartment really does not matter me that much, as my basic needs (safety) was not fulfilled in this apartment."
"The apartment was as it was described at Air-Bnb  The heaters were working properly The TV is working, but I had to change batteries from one remote control to the other. The only problem that Emmanuel can fix it is as it is preferred to provide and small towels. The region is quite, the metro station one minute walk, many cafes, supermarkets and bakeries around"
This apartment was in a central place in Paris close to train and bus stations. The only fault was it was a smaller than expected and too stuffy no fans or ventilation.
Very close to the train station and bus stops. There is a market close by.
"Pros: Very central location to all metro/ RER stations and walking distance to many  shops, museums, monuments Clean , stylish apartment Kitchen Appliances  plush washer / dryer  Cons: Noise  and  rowdy crowds from all the bars on the street- bring ear plugs Dark entrance way, No light in hallway to see elevator lock to insert key Limited amenities- no coffee pods for machine, few towels, ran out of paper products . Blinds did not fully close in main living space"
"This is such a wonderful apartment.  The location is very close to the Eiffel tower.  The two closest metro stations were closed during our visit so we had to make use of taxis or our feet for more of our travel than we expected, but we knew that travel during these strange times would provide some challenges and we were just fine.  Some other reviews mention mosquitos.  They are a problem, but I think that is just France in the summer.  They are a problem anywhere that can't keep the windows closed for most of the day.  We would stay here again."
Broken bed.  When I arrived the host told me that the bed was broken and that I should not move to much. It gave away the moment I sat down.  One of the nights the bed collapsed. The host told me he would fix it and refunded that night.  By the last night I was sleeping with the mattress on the floor because the bed was still broken. The room could use some cleaning. When I was sleeping on the floor I could definitely see all the dust on the floor below the bed. Bathroom and kitchen could use cleaning too.  The location is good. There are two metro stations nearby.
"The location was great, metro station round the corner, supermarket and kebab shop outside if you fancy a night in.  The only slight issue we had was climbing the stairs. If you're worried about missing your routine squat session, no need to worry, these stairs provide the work out you need!! All in all I do highly recommend this place to anyone that wants to experience Paris."
"I would not recommend anyone to stay here, to be honest, this is my worst experience with Airbnb!  The metro station is close, however it is not as safe as expected since we experienced a pickpocket issue in the nearest metro station chateau d'eau. The apartment is big enough but in the fourth floor without elevators so travellers with large luggages might think twice.   The most unhappy experience is that the host's washing machine runs out of electricity the minute we use it, and they blame us for using it for using it as a laundry shop but we only washed around 5 t-shirts which is common in summer. Even I bought the insurance as they required before they come, they still want to CHARGE me nearly 500 euros for the washing machine although they promised the insurance will cover everything!! And the issue still lasts till now, ten days after the check-out, which caused me a lot of troubles!!  Overall, not a happy experience. This is the first time I write negative comments for a host, sorry about that but I would NEVER rent this apartment again."
"It is a nice place in strategic location, many restaurants, kafe and mall, near to metro station, right place to explore beautiful Paris. However, poor mobile signal in the building and no wifi available during our stay due to technical problem."
"Paid ¬£1333 for 4 nights stay, average ¬£333 per night. I would say it is not a good deal because the bad side are more than good. The good side: 1. owner is responsive, helpful and proactive. 2. The location is very good,  metro station is right at the door side. 3. Room is clean when gaining entrance. The bad side: 1. Smaller than expected. 2. The sound insulation is very poor. We can neighbors' taking, taking bath, flushing toilet etc. 3. The windows are not double glazed. When closing the windows, we can still hear the people and car noise from the street. 4. The lift is very old style with out-dated mechanics. Space are very small. Waiting time is long. 5. There is an ATM right next to the main entrance. Many local people youngsters stays near there from day to night, so when you open the entrance door, they are watching you. It feels unsafe especially at the night time."
"Rustic apartment in the heart of Paris A four-bedroom (for 8 people) apartment just about one block away from Tower Eifel, a chance to live true citylife in Paris. Grocery store (200 m), metro station (100 m), restaurants in the same house. What else do one need? Two toilets, three bathrooms in three different floors. Dishwasher & washing machine worked well.  In front of the apartment is a road which is quite busy but the bedrooms are quiet. No house on the opposite side, there is a sporting ground for football/soccer players & athletics.     Only minus is the height of ceilings. I as a tall person (> 190 cm / 6‚Äù4¬¥) did hit my head several times.   Our six person team (grandparents & a family of four) felt ourselves really welcome. Thank you Anne & Alice ‚Äì we had suberb time in your apartment!"
Very unpleasant experience. The apartment is in a old building close to train station. Quite a lot Arabian and black people wondering on the street. The room is small and not clean enough. The worst thing is the boiler start to make strange noise and I could not even sleep for two nights. On the second night the boiler stopped to work and I have to leave on third afternoon. Will not suggest this place for anyone.
"The apartment is well located, right in the 11th arrondisement and close to the Saint-Maur metro station. There is a Franprix close by and some restaurants. Low points were: definitely the bathtub. There is no shower in the apartment, it was very difficult to shower without wetting the whole bathroom, it is very uncomfortable to stand in that small bathtub. I feel like I spent a week taking a bad shower. Another point is that, like many apartments in Paris, if you have mobility problems, this space is not the best, as it is on the fourth floor, without an elevator. And lastly, in summer, the apartment gets very hot. I don't mind, I'm used to it! But for those who can't sleep in the heat, here's the tip. Fran√ßois is very nice, though."
"The apartment was in acceptable condition, but very small for 3 people and very far from the city centre. The bathroom was shockingly tiny and very dark. Yamna had scribbled many signs all over the bathroom, which wasn't very classy and made us feel like we were using the toilet of a petrol station! Yamna wasn't always very good with replies, as she used the AirBnB app to reply to my questions which I sent via SMS. This was problematic as one doesn't always have internet access while travelling.   The furniture was also in poor condition. One chair broke when I sat on it as it was assembled poorly. Another coffee table tumbled over when we placed things on it as it was assembled without screws!  Overall this place was in nice neighbourhood, but you get what you pay for. Proceed with caution."
"The place is very convenient and fits three people with no problem. It‚Äôs 4 minutes away from the subway station and a bus stop, so you can get around with no problem. There‚Äôs also a supermarket next door where you can get anything you need. The hosts were very responsive and extremely nice."
"The host is great‚ù§Ô∏è he always answers me immediately! However I think in general there is still something to be improved  The apartment is not clean I saw some hair and dirt in the room (but it is not ‚Äúdirty‚Äù ~) And also maybe more supplements will be better, there is six of us and we are staying for three night. But there is only four small pack of shower supplements üò≠ Also there is a broken floor in front of bathroom, we have to cross the broken floor whenever we pass the area ( and the broken floor wasn‚Äôt informed nor mentioned in advance) Also the door for bathroom and toilet can not be locküò≠ it could be a little bit awkward for people who is not family üò≠ But still, I think the location is great, there‚Äôs subway nearby and also bus station"
"The apartment is located in a very diverse and interesting area, other residents are long time Parisians. The area represents many cultures and different foods. The metro station is very close.  The bed in the apartment is about 1.5 meters off the floor and is not easy to get in and out of. In warmer weather noise from street will be a problem and there is no screen on the window."
"The location is perfect really close to the Louvre and Centre Pompidou and several metro stations, right in the city centre. But the flat was not clean when we arrived to drop off our luggage around 12, our fridge was broken an there was water on the floor, we told C√©dric about it and he said it would be cleaned until we can check in at 3pm but when we came back around 10pm nothing was cleaned and the floor was still wet. We got another apartment for that night which was okay but the next day the fridge was gone and the bathroom was still dirty with hair all over the floor and on the bedsheets after we had repeatedly asked him to clean it. Communication with C√©dric wasn‚Äôt great as he didn‚Äôt seem to understand the problem of a missing fridge and a dirty bathroom and told us the next day that the apartment apparently had been cleaned before we arrived even though the day before he said it hadn‚Äôt been cleaned yet and they would come between 12 and 3pm. In the end we got a new fridge and cleaned the bathroom ourselves so it was okay. But if you are looking for a clean apartment this is definitely not the place to go to."
"The apartment is well located near La Merais. You are a short walk from tourist sights but in a more local area. The apartment is missing some conveniences, ie. two adults were only were given two towels for four days, there are only two flat pillows on the bed, no full length mirror, nowhere to hang a coat or bag. The dryer does not work and there is no drying rack, so we left with a bag of wet clothing after doing laundry the night before, even after running the dryer function four times. The apartment is freezing in the winter and doesn‚Äôt seem to have any central heat, but the space heaters provided do a good job. Bring ear plugs because the street below is quite noisy - there must be a hospital or fire station nearby because we were hearing sirens constantly."
The location makes this place ideal. itis quite small so not great for more than two people. It is well equipped with everything you need and has great security. Lincoln was quick to respond and great with directions on how to get from the train station to the apartment. Would highly recommend to anyone who wants to be right in the middle of all the action. Plus it is close to a metro station. 
"Great location. Noisy, but 20 min walk from Eiffel tower, 10 min walk to different underground station etc. Really great location for exploring city center. Unfortunately:  1. The kitchen and fridge were full of leftover food and aromatic things (lots of garlic in the fridge and strange leftovers). It was not very pleasant when every opening of the fridge meant a smell all the way to the next room. 2. The apartment isn't comfortable ... maybe good for photos, but really not comfortable for resting ... toilets are so small, that bigger person like me has real trouble fitting in :) or maybe :(. 3. Going up 5 flights of stairs at the end of the day, which is really warm in the summer, is not exactly a pleasant end to the day (the fact that there is no elevator in the house is written in the offer and we knew it in advance ... but it was not pleasant)."
"Very responsive, accommodating, and helpful host. The location was noisy at night with sirens from emergency vehicles, but close to metro and major rail stations, so we had no difficulty getting around. It's a bit warm at night in summer without air conditioning, but that's France, I guess."
The flat is located in a quiet neighborhood with a metro station close by.  Unfortunately the flat was not clean at all and there was a strong smell of cigarettes. Due to these circumstances we decided to check out of the apartment after our first night.  The communication with Stephanie went smoothly and she was sorry about the problems.
"Chris is a very nice man,house near metro station, and it takes 5 minutes to go there. It has everything in the house, but the wifi is not good."
"The only positive about this flat was the position, 5 minutes walking from a metro station and next to bar, restaurants and supermarkets, but the flat was terrible. Was not possible to lock the main door with the key and the inside doors didn't close properly, we could hear the neighbors and everybody going up and down from the stairs, the bed was super hard and uncomfortable, the hairdryer was not working, the towels had a bad smell. I suggest it only if you're looking for a cheap flat just for sleep."
"Good area close to metro stations,  good place for 2-4 people max.  Leo was a great host,  let us check our luggage in early and check in 2 hours early.    The only thing worth mentioning as far as negative would be the five flights of stairs with no elevator.  We were fine with it but if you are older,  out of shape or have a disability would be a problem.   We would stay here again though after the experience we had."
"This place is typical of many apartments in Paris - a nice location but shabby inside, a bit noisy and horrendously overpriced.  Unfortunately there is such high demand for accommodation that owners can get away with doing the bare minimum/ standards that would be unacceptable elsewhere.  We were very frustrated about noisy construction work going on (building covered in scaffolding) - which had already started at the time of our booking but the owner failed to mention.  We complained about this but received no response.  We found it pathetic that the owner won't allow use of the washing machine given the price paid. Whenever someone uses the lift or staircase the noise echoes round the whole building - this will likely disrupt your sleep.  The apartment is not recently renovated (perhaps it was 10 years ago) - mould in bathroom, ill-fittings blinds, cheap uncomfortable mattresses, thin pillows, very old fridges, beds so high they are unsuitable for children, ant infestation."
"The apartment is very well located (2 mins away from the Metro station I√©na from where it doesn't take long to get anywhere).  Unfortunately, no one (neither in the description nor in the comments) had mentioned before that there is no door between the bathroom and the rest of the apartment. Furthermore,  the whole electricity shut at one point down so due to that we did not have any light, plugs or WiFi working. The Concierge as well as Edouard could not help us at all which was a shame as we were ""sitting"" in the dark the whole time (showering, packing etc literally in the dark) because not even the shutters were moving up anymore."
"Acceptable for one night and maximum two people because the apartment is really small and uncomfortabl The good thing is the ubication,  the metro stations are relatively close.  I don't recommend Elodie's apartment if you will be late check in you have to pay a commission of 30 to 50 euros depending on the arrival time, and you have to pay in cash as soon as they give you the key. I agreed with that, and I paid it becaue I arrived late, but I disagree and I let Elodie know it was in the bad treatment and rudeness by Nazeem who was the one who gave me the key, it was the most rude person. I arrived later than we agreed because my train was delayed and I also got lost due to repairs at gare du nord. I told Nazeem that I would be late and gave him the status of my location continuously, but when he finally gave me the key he kept telling me how upset he was, in the end I had to pay a commission of 50 euros and get bad faces. I could have stayed in a better place, learn from my mistake. On the other hand, make sure you take shampoo and soap with you, since the one you leave is not enough."
Pros: Stylish little apartment in Paris. Very close to two metro stations and about 20 min from all the main sights. Decent Wi-Fi and all amenities.  Cons: In a slightly sketchy area with mostly Indian restaurants and stores (not much French foods/pastries/cafes). Three flights of stairs up to the room. Does not look like the pictures! There is more furniture and personal effects taking up the space.
"Unfortunately I had a bad experience , while the host seems kind and well intentioned . This flat is in one of the worst parts of Paris . There are many homeless people outside the front door( thousands).  Stalingrad train station is one of the worst stations in Paris and outside the front door is a squatting area right under the train bridge . I was also unable to reach the host for 1 hour and as a result unable to get in. And then had to book a hotel due to these issues . The price of the flat also doesn‚Äôt match the horrible location . This was my worst experience with Airbnb unfortunately as I am also having issues with refund. And don‚Äôt recommend this area especially for any females traveling alone."
"Thought apartment is close to metro station,  location is bad.  On the first night, a dude push himself through the door. We had to kick him out. On the second night, there was no lights aluminating the entrance, hallway or stairs- which are falling apart. The neighborhood is extremelly loud at night; noise can be heard up to 3am. No elevator and apartment is on the 4th floor-5th floor if you count the actual levels. So beware if you are traveling with a lot of luggage.  Overall clean. Even though the listing claims to provide towels, bring towels.  We were only giving one for a two adult RSVP- and were asked to not touch any available in the bathroom. Bring hand soap- the one we got was encrusted with dirt."
The lodging is located near Gare du Nord station which is great for transportation as it‚Äôs also an international railway point. The area is filled with restaurants but in terms of cleanliness the community is not particularly the best.
"Perfect! I never expected to be in a hostel with that quality. It really is different from any hostel concept that I have been to before. Recommend 100% It is a very good hostel. It is close to the metro station, but I do not recommend going back too late for it, as Paris is not a very safe city. The bathroom is a little dirty, but that is no problem at the hostel. In general, it is an excellent option."
"Pros Wonderful location surrounded by various Metro stations, restaurants, fast food etc.  Jonathan was always responsive  Apartment was nicely decorated if a tad spartan Cons Some may not know however Rue de Ponthieu also has 2-3 bars which convert into nightclubs that ended up with people shouting, cars stopping to chat with club-goers which thus led to the cars behind (it's a one way street, mind) hitting their horns repeatededly from about 4am until 7am. This happened to us on Saturday, Sunday and Wednesday early morning - it may be an isolated occurence but travelers be warned as it led to poor sleep, kids being woken etc. The street itself was a mess as a result with used balloons, cream canisters, urine and empty beer bottles strewn out the front of the apartment and all along the Rue. A real shame but this point needs to be highlighted, sorry Jonathan.  The car park is ok if you drive a small car but anything large ie. Range Rover will be a logistical nightmare to navigate the tight turns down to underground level 5. Mind the low ceiling too when opening the 4WD boot door as in our tired state, we opened it without thinking and there is now a dent in the middle of the door."
"Everything fine except dirty WC welcomed us.  Pros: Near to metro and bus station, beautiful balcony view, cosy home feeling with heater, Big TV, Kitchen, self checkin. Cons : may find weird to see personal stuff for some guest but we didn't mind, dusty corners near the bed corners, WC not so clean and always anxious before entering as it is shared."
"Our host has been very kind. We found a bottle of milk and two bottles of water at our arrive. He also left several nespresso coffe cups for us and some little other consumable in the kitchen. There is also a microwave owen. The apartment was not much clean and the host told me this the day of our arrive. Of course we would have preferred to enter in a cleaner apartment.  The apartment is at the third floor without elevator and I do not remember that we were informed about this. The floor is in a bad preservation state (parquet) and is very noisy. The doors do not close well and the bathroom is not confortable at all, being the services splitted into two separate rooms. The bedroom has no light and the window of the bathroom has no blind.  This is not an apartment for two couples, but only for a family of four persons. I say this because to use the shower it is necessary to pass through the bedroom.  The sofa is dirty and it would benefit of a deep washing. The same holds for the cushions and the other components of the beds. The bed sheets were not ironed.  There is no TV, which is important to know in case of rainy days. Also the lights can be greatly improved. It is 10-15 minute walking from the metro 6 (station Glaciere).  In conclusion the cost is not expensive, but also the general quality of the apartment is not high."
"Warning! Stay away from this place. The host doesn't send you any instruction (exact address, digi code, full name, metro station). You have to chase the information yourself! We were stuck at the train station with no reply from Alexandre. When we finally reached him, he was very arrogant, refusing to give more information and even threatening to cancel the booking! When we finally manage to get there, we discovered a flat with no wifi, no tv, dirty shower with blocked water. There was supposed to be a nice terrace but the neighbours chased us away promptly arguing we had no rights to be here. And the host no right to welcome guests. After being waken up by the workers down the streets, that was it! We just needed to run away from there... Alexandre missed our check out appointment as he missed the check in the day earlier. So our overall stay was terrible. Such was the behaviour of Alexandre. Definitely not recommended at all..."
"You wouldn't expect the unit has the same entrance of a grand looking hotel. Very near the metro and bus station. It was however, the toilet described is a public toilet where you have to pay 2.50 euros to have a hot shower. Not the best place for someone who needs to have regular shower. Wifi can only be connected on 1 device at a time. "
"Two bedroom apartment on first floor (second floor by American standards). One bathroom has a small shower and toilet with washer/dryer. The other bathroom has a larger shower with sink, no toilet. There is a third restroom with toilet and small sink. The kitchen is tiny, but well-equipped.  The two bedrooms are quiet at night but the front room is quite noisy if you have the windows open. Despite being a smaller street, trucks and  trailers  and trash collectors made extremely loud noises that woke us up and scared us! Seriously, the apartment shook. If you use the sofa bed, it becomes a bit cramped in the apartment. These were minor concerns, and overall the apartment is great and in a convenient location, close to two of the Metro stations. The hosts had great recommendations for food and responded quickly to any questions I had. My least favorite part of the apartment was the artwork‚Äîthere were many paintings on the walls, all by the same artist, each with a naive, quirky bohemian quality. But being an artist and art professor, and coming to Paris to see great art, I was a bit horrified to look at these things! Plus they are painted on cheap canvases which were warping badly. If you are not an art critic, it probably won‚Äôt bother you!"
"The apartment is very close to a metrostation, so that's nice. The communication with No√© before our visit went perfect and we could check in and out anytime we wanted. The room was big but the apartment was not clean. Especially the bathroom was dirty. Its located along a street with a lot of bars and restaurants, so it was quite noisy during the night. The hosts themselves came in late with quite some noise, which awaked us."
"This is a sweet flat at heart, but it is run down and tired and needs money spent on it to justify the price being charged. The living room is a very nice space and bedrooms, while small, are perfectly fine. The location right next to Pigalle station is handy, if a little noisy. However, the kitchen is terrible - it is absolutely tiny, has no counter space, is very poorly equipped (no chopping boards, no mugs, bad knives, limited crockery) and the only place for the kettle was positively dangerous (perched on a high shelf). It is not really possible, or at least very stressful, to cook for a family, so self-catering is difficult. The cooker was dirty and stained. The towels were very old and, whilst clean, had odour to them and the bathroom had an inadequate shower with no shower curtain or screen. The bed in the main bedroom was extremely hard and uncomfortable and  one of the (3 in total) pillows provided was unusable because it was disintegrating and lumpy. The attractive parquet flooring is falling apart and squeaks practically wherever you tread on it. The flat, while appearing superficially clean had a lot of accumulated dirt and dust in corners on beds, shelves etc. It is clear that a lot of people are passing through it. This has the potential to be a really great place to stay, but it is not being maintained to an adequate standard and, for the price, is not good value."
"Nice location. Close to metro stations, restaurants and shops. Apartment was old, dark and not well lit. Towels had holes. Had to request shampoo and body wash. Some light bulbs were out. Was clean but building was old and worn down."
"Spent a week here with my 2 teenage daughters. Just the right size as we had a full kitchen and I had a separate bedroom from them. We all had our own bed. All the necessities where there for cooking, cleaning, showers, etc...  Very close to a grocery store, 2 metro stations, a bus stop right in front, and tons of restaurants.  The reality of apartment does match the pictures."
"1. Hostess: Pierre always reply very quickly to all my questions and everything he told me made the difference in the trip. Pierre offer as gift a bottle of wine! 2. Location: The neighborhood is safe and busy all hours of the day, has supermarkets, pharmacies, restaurants and the metro station is just a short walk from the apartment. 3: When I arrived it was clean and cozy. The space is not very big however it is enough for two people. The building does not have a lift but I had no problem."
"Spacious, well-lit apartment, close to city centre and railway stations. Lots of closet  space. We're in our 60s, and didn't have any trouble with the stairs.  Good communication with host. Only downside was lack of internet, but I was able to use my cell phone as wifi hotspot for most purposes.."
"Valerie was a nice host and kept in touch throughout her stay. The place has an absolute doll of a cat next door, is quick to heat up and is conveniently located near the Metro station. However check in was extremely difficult, the way in is not suited for anyone with a mobility issue, quite unstable, and the bed was extremely uncomfortable and could use some proper bedding.  Convenient but not comfortable."
"The use of the bathroom was really confusing as she did not showed us the bathroom that had the toilet in, but rather, it was just the cat's room. The bathroom with the toilet also had the cat's litter box, which she did not clean while we stayed there so it smelled pretty bad. Also, we had no Wi-fi after the second day and it was a big problem for us to keep up with work while we stayed. Other than that, the apartment was nice, clean and close to a subway station."
"Chic parisian apartment with nice view and close to metro station. The neighborhood is a bit strange at night, but had no problems."
"Good for 1 nights stay, concierge was accommodating in keeping our bags after we checked out till it was time to go back to the train station later that evening so we could keep exploring the city. Other reviews are very accurate in how small it really was. Very tight for two but enough for cheap 1 night in Paris. Only negative I would say is my room has stained sheets which kinda wierded us out"
"Central, very close to the station, subway and Bus stop to airport CDG. Great for very short stay. Basic room/flat."
"There apartment is well located near metro stations, good shops and cafes near Sant Severin church.All the windows look into the yard. So you can sleep with open windows and street noise will not bother you. The cat is not a problem. Most of the time it was under the bed. There are lots of nice eastern details such as a lamp and different plates and vases. Some musical instruments which my children liked a lot.  The kitchen is too small for a family. It is ok for cooking but only one person can eat there comfortably. The apartment was not clean. The floor, the curtains , some shelves were dusty. The bathroom was not cleaned properly. And there were some wet dirty sheets in the washing machine which smelled very bad."
"The stay was as listed, a quiet cozy room, very close to metro station and bus stops. There was no access to wifi , be aware that there is a cat in the home incase of allergies."
"The location is good‚Äîthere are a few metro stations nearby and it‚Äôs a 20 minute walk from the Eiffel Tower. However, it is a very small and old studio. Some kitchen wears seemed not washed properly and there was a weird smell in the kitchen cupboard. Otherwise the studio is alright to stay in if you don‚Äôt have high standards. The communication with the host was a bit of a struggle since the host spoke poor English and we did not understand any French. There was one time we were talking to the host figuring how to lock the door (the door lock is very tricky) but she was very unhelpful and rude over the phone. That was the only time we got pretty annoyed. But other than that, the online communication seemed fine!"
Apartment is cosy. 5 minutes walk to bus stop and Gare St. Lazare train station. Lots of restaurant and supermarket nearby.
"The location, just a 10-minute walk from the metro station, offered a great view from the balcony, making it worth the price. However, the bed was uncomfortable, with worn bed sheets needing replacement. Noise from a nearby school during its hours was disruptive, and a broken automatic window curtain was an inconvenience, though the host provided manual instructions. Additionally, the absence of window screens allowed bugs in during our stay."
"I don‚Äôt have really an issue with the location and the Bnb. Me and my wife decided to save money and go with something affordable in Paris. We found this Bnb and from the pictures seemed like it would do it‚Äôs purpose.   Here are the Pros: the stay was cost effective, the building felt relatively safe despite the neighborhood, Nicolas was easy to reach, had a working mini fridge, and the Bnb was close to the train station. Cons:  Hot water wasn‚Äôt always available, sheets on bed didn‚Äôt look clean (hair was on the sheets and it looked slept in), dirty neighborhood.  Now, I would normally leave my review at that however I do have one complaint. On our first night at the Bnb, we wanted to take a hot shower after a long day of travel. The shower was not producing hot water so we messaged Nicolas and he responded inappropriately. First he seemed to imply that I was lying about the hot water not working. And then he accused me of being too weak to turn the shower knob.  We felt very insulted by the way he was speaking with us. (I have videos and messages of our incident) The issue seemed to be coming from a lack of hot water in the building or water heater? So throughout our trip we resolved to take really short showers, as it happened every night of our stay."
"On the plus side, the apartment is lovely, with a view onto the Place Monge. It's convenient to the Metro: about 20 feet from a station. The kitchen is nice, if you plan to eat in. (If you do, you can shop at the outdoor market that is in the Place Monge 3 days a week.) There were some issues with the water heater, but I was able to work with it. The main problem is that the apartment is on the very top, sixth floor of the building (seventh floor for an American)... and the elevator is broken. That's a lot of stairs. This is particularly a hassle when you first arrive and have heavy luggage, but it's never especially fun. I chatted with other residents of the building that I encountered on the stairs, who told me the elevator has been non-functional for ""about two months."" Yet no mention was made of this in the ad when I booked the apartment: a sixth-floor walkup typically rents for much less than an apartment served by a lift. I asked the management company (that handles this unit for the owner) about the elevator -- twice -- but never got a reply to that specific issue. I assume that at some point the elevator will be fixed, so this won't be a long-term issue."
The property was nice but there are some notes:  good points: - 2 metro stations nearby. - the size of the balcony was good. negative points:  - the area not the best in Paris and it is far away from most attractions. - there is no kettle in the room. - the host forgot to give me the remote control for the parking gate!  - the shower was little bit broken! - the room was not clean that we expected. - the parking was very tight.
"We stayed at Aurelia's for three days. She was in other country when we arrived buy she had prepared a guideline for us before very well. Good location! You can get on the metro just 300m walk to Saint Paul station. The room is good for two people but for three, a little space problem. The flat is on 4th floor with no elevator so it will be a big problem if you have big luggage. Aurelia gave us a lot of recommendations for the places shouldn't miss around the flat and kept contact us during our stay. "
"The apartment had a major bedbug infestation. We were refunded for our stay but not offered any compensation for lost expenses on luggage, damaged clothes, alternate accommodations, and medical visits, to name a few. Our skin lesions are not even close to healed nearly 2 weeks later. Absolute nightmare of a vacation. Note to all: check your bed before settling in to any accommodation."
"BEWARE! We were 5 people who booked between 16-22 September. On the 19th, after we returned at night  from a concert, someone entered the apartment and stole our cash money and searched through all our clothes. I sent immediately messages to the owner, HE SAW THE MESSAGES but responded to them AFTER 6 HOURS, which was very suspicious. I also contacted the police 3 times on that night. We didn't sleep and we were scared that someone will enter again. The next day, I contacted again the police but no one came to the apartment to see the videos on the cameras, they said that the owner must be there also. The owner didn't want to come to see what happened. He accused me of lying and wanting to take money from him after I leave. I made a statement at the police station and the owner then got angry and was still accusing me of lying and making things up! Now, after 4 days since I arrived back home, he also wants to send him a lot of money for the lock on the door, which I didn't break!"
"I have both good and bad comment for this flat‚Ä¶ Good points: This flat is clean and cozy, location is convenient as few minutes walk from some metro stations. James was easy to communicate and kind to us at checking in. AC was nice to have for hot summer. Bad points: First of all, hot water was not available while my stay. I had to use icy shower as I was too sweaty to skip it‚Ä¶ Not pleasant experience. James told us that he will fix it but it never happened and I wasn‚Äôt informed if he tried, or what was the issue. Adding some miner points, switch of shower heads was broken, some of sockets were unavailable."
"Sylvia doesn‚Äôt speak a lot of English but went out of her way to communicate through translate apps. The apartment is very close to the metro station...the metro system in Paris is INCREDIBLE! Don‚Äôt waste time with Ubers and taxis, get metro tickets!"
"Giovanni is a very helpful and communicative host. He gives great recommendations and answers any questions! The house is located in a good area with plenty of metro stations,  restaurants, small grocery stores near by. The room is on the ground floor with hedges and greenery surrounding so with that comes a lot of spiders‚Ä¶ they are mostly harmless daddy long leg spiders you can trap and release outside. But if you have a fear of them, this might not be the best place for you. Overall, I enjoyed my stay here."
"The staff was very helpful with luggage drop before and after check-in, and they helped me with a taxi to the airport as well. The room was very clean and neat. The hotel is near Velib stations and the metro, so no problem getting around in central Paris but if you think of Quartier Latin as Place de La Sorbonne or Pantheon - it‚Äôs quite a long walk to that part of the neighborhood. (Note also that the room has no minibar or kettle.)"
"We have been planning our family trip to Paris for quite a while, due to the fact that we had the Covid situation. Finally we decided to book for Paris. We booked with your company an apartment in Paris, two months prior our holiday.  Paid everything and started planning our holiday,bearing in mind the area of the apartment, so we checked means of transportation, what metros and trains to take as this was our first time visiting France. On our departure date, as we were about to leave Malta, my son had a phone call from the apartment, it did not come through so we send a message, we got the shock of our lives, stating that we cannot stay at the apartment as there was a problem with the drainage. So the flight took off, we could not communicate as we were flying. So we spent 3 hours worrying about the situation. As soon as we arrived, we connected them, and they said that they can offer 2 apartments from the 14 th tll 16th and then they will find another apartment for the rest of the holiday. We asked them that although we wanted to stay together, we will take their offer, but asked them if we can stay the whole duration, and not have to pack our things and move out to go to another apartment.And also on the 16th we had booked to visit Eurodisney so we couldn't move out. After long discussions, they stated that they can not offer anything else, and that is the situation. They can refund the money. So we had to search right there in the middle of the bus station in the cold for an alternative accommodation. After searching for about an hour we found an apartment, more expensive than the one we booked, in a different zone. This has caused us a lot of tension and worry, as all that we planned regarding travelling to visit places via metro and trains was no longer good. We informed the agent and asked for an immediate refund, as we had to pay the other apartment. He said he will talk to the accounts.  The refund was not effected ,so we had to fork out our spending money to pay for the apartment. So after this lenghtly complain, we are asking for a compansation on these grounds: LAST minute Information, literary while we were boarding the plane. Offered 2 apartments,for half of our stay and did not confirm where we will be transferred for the rest of our holiday. We had to search for apartment there and then . Inconvenience,as  where we found the apartment was a different area,so we had to search every time to see how we were going to get to the place where we wanted to visit.We had already planned . Short of money until the money was transferred to our account. The  pressure and uncertainties, that we had to endure at the start of our family holiday."
"I‚Äôm afraid the bedroom is not clean enough, and the house is relatively far from the subway station."
"Oliver's place is really well located. The neighborhood has really nice vibe with cafes, bars, restaurants at just walking distance. Also, it is really well connected by metro, with station at 6min walk.  I've rented this place out for a trip with my family (4 people). However, this place was a studio suitable for only one to two people max. This made our stay really uncomfortable. It was my mistake though, as I should have made sure that this was a studio with everything in the same room: bed-livingroom-diningroom.  I just watched the photos and thought it has at least a separate bedroom. My recommendation is that the owner should rent this for a max two people, specially because this is his own studio full of personal belongings. At the end, we got some problems with the carpet, and felt bad about it."
"Appartment was near to Sacr√© Coeur, supermarkets and restaurants. The nearest metro station seems kind of dangerous but we had no problem with it."
"I spent almost 2 weeks at Alexis place as I was in Paris for a work commitment. The flat is quite central and most of the amenities are at walking distance, also it‚Äôs closed to both Gare di Nord and Gare de l‚Äôest. Even though it‚Äôs close to the train station I felt extremely safe even coming back at night.  The sofa bed is massive and quite comfortable, the kitchen is perfect for getting something quick ready, and finally the bathroom is huge and freshly renovated. If I have to pick something I would say that the building is quite old and sometimes you hear the neighbor due to thin walls. But that never happened during the night, so no problem for sleeping."
"[Medium Experience] Pre-Check-in communication was fast and efficienct. When you come from airport to Trocadero station for the first time, you see the Eiffel Tower immediately. Great experience. Room is close to the tower.  Check in was very good. As described correctly the room is at 6th floor with no elevator. This let us think twice about coming back spontaneously to the room during the day.  First impression of room is clean. The mould in shower tub was very disgusting. After communicating the problem to Kev he reacted quickly, but the problem was not fixed. My wife didn't take a shower at all during our 4 night  stay. The folding bed is uncomfortable.  We will come back in September to Paris again, but will choose another room."
"The apartment was nice and cozy albeit a bit small for my family of 5 with big luggages. The extra 5th bed was an inflatable bed and it was uncomfortable and bouncy according to my 15year old son so he end up sleeping at the sofa instead. As mentioned in previous reviews, be prepared to carry your luggages through small staircases leading to the apartment and upon checking out. Should be fine for hand carry luggages but dreadful if your luggages weigh around 25kg a piece! However, the location is very convenient as it is close to a lot of shops and restaurants and short walk to the metro/train station which was a big plus!"
"18th arrondissemont is one of the more authentic neighborhoods to stay at and one of my favorite places to visit when in Paris. And what a great location: right by the bus 38 Les Roses stop and Marx Dormoy station of metro 12. Walk further more and you will find one of the more incredible unique everyday scenes in Paris: outside the subway station of La Chapelle. The room and apartment are fine for a short stay. Don't expect a typical Airbnb decorated room, but a usual room in an older building in this part of Paris. I booked a stay for five nights, but cut it short. I needed a stable Wi-Fi connection to work remotely during my stay. There was no Wi-Fi as advertised, which is a shame. Leo let me connect to his iPhone hotspot when he was home, but the connection wasn't strong enough for a Zoom meeting. In the end, I had to find a new place at the last minute and ended up paying more than what I had planned. That said, as hosts, Nicholas and Leo are laidback and responsive to messages."
"The place is located 20 min walking from tour eiffel and close to metro stations and supermarkets. My only problem is that it wasn't easy to find, and we called the host to help but they don't speak English, even though I would assume most of their clients are foreigners so a basic understanding of English should be expected. Maybe some pictures of the entrance in the building will help future guests. Also I must mention that the apartment is at the 5th floor and I would not recommend it to everybody.  And there was no soap or shower gel to wash our hands."
"Actually the place is fine: very near to the East railway station. Good bakeries few walking minutes away. Supermarket, restaurants etc. are very near and the typical Paris sights are almost a stone throw away. Interesting interior. Kitchen has almost anything you need. Lots of space for two persons. Faustine is helpful, even at nightly times! But there are things she cannot solve: Very noisy neighbours. In our case we had the feeling to life right under a Discothek at our second night. Starting at 12 p.m. The noise ceased only after the police came (some hours later after we called, but nevertheless!), started again after the police went, ended at last (it was 3:30 a.m.). So we decided to move out. There were no problems at all with Faustine!"
"I stayed at this place with 2 of my friends for a week.  I chose this place for the price and the location. With both of those things, I was satisfied. 5/5 stars for the location as we were very close to a metro station with direct access to all the lines we needed in order to visit Paris.  The cleanliness of the place was very much appreciated as well.  However, there was some discomfort on basic necessities that explains the lower cost compared to similar properties which I believe guests should be aware of in order to make their choice: - there is a limit on hot water (3 people can't shower comfortably because the hot water runs out and we had to wait for 1h for the next person to be able to shower. it was a big problem especially as we had to wash our hair as well, not only shower.) - the bed is very creaky and shaky (on every move it would make a creaky sound and it disturbed the others sleeping) - the walls are very thin (like others leaving reviews here, I can confirm that you can hear the neighbors all around. however, there was generally no more noise between 00:00 and 07:00.)"
"Host is friendly and helpful but did not speak very good English so communication was a little difficult but still alright. Apartment location is not really central although it is close to a train station (if you are planning to travel around by the Metro, it is very convenient). If you are not comfortable with stairs or not having a private toilet, this is not the place for you. It is alright for a short stay. Do not bring oversized luggage as lugging them up 4 flights of narrow and steep steps is not easy."
"The place was  cozy and okay for a couple. its 4-5 minutes walk to Eiffel Tower thats the only benefit i could feel. Apart from this , bus stop was 5 minties walk, metro station was more than 15-20 minutes walk. Everything was okay. The main thing i did not like is with the facilities in the apartment with respect to cooking. We usually book airbnb keeping in mind to have home like stay where we would like to cook as well. But we were surprised to see there was not even a single utensils on which could cook though she gave a day later upon asking. Also soap in washroom was used, no oil, and no items in kitchen/washroom. Room was hot. I have been in airbnb many times before but this was the first experience with airbnb like this."
"So what was good about the apartment: - Very nicely designed bedrooms, hall and elevator. Brings a bit of Paris vibe - Location close to metro and train stations What was bad: - Reception was terrible. We were not able to check in time due to misalignment of the hosting company workers. They were actually lying about the current status and did not manage the expectations right - Barely enough room to sit on toilet - Bathroom smells like sewerage in middle bedroom despite there being no toilet in there - Cold water for shower - No iron - No toilet rolls - No shampoo etc as advertised - Door temperamental and handle would get stuck meaning we were locked out for hours at a time  - Can't adjust temperature and all windows open on arrival so apartment was very cold"
Staying at Erwann‚Äôs will make your trip unforgettable. It‚Äôs 15 minutes away from the Sacred Heart Basilica. It‚Äôs walking distance to the metro station. There are several restaurants and bars close by. Don‚Äôt hesitate to book your stay.
"The position of the apartment is very good, a metro station is nearby, shops and restaurants around. But it is not so clean: the sofa is very dirty, and both the sofa and the bed in the bedroom creak very loudly."
"Peaceful and quiet apartment within walking distance to a nice park, some cute restaurants and local supermarkets. Takes about an hour to walk to Notre Dame and 45 ish to Eiffel Tower which was nice to do and see the areas on foot. Metro station around the corner was also very useful. Only thing I‚Äôd mention is I thought I was booking a double room rather than two singles which is why I booked this one over others of the same price that were more central. In the pictures it‚Äôs a double bed but in the apartment it‚Äôs two singles and slightly different layout. My fault for missing that it states 2 singles in the description but think the pictures should also reflect that. Wi-Fi didn‚Äôt work but we tried the same password on the other apartment‚Äôs connection and managed to get online that way."
"Very close to the metro station and plenty of places to find something to eat. The place had a pungent smell to the building entry and to the apartment. There is very little to no plates and cutlery and other essentials like dishwashing liquid, washing powder. I found the towels to be not clean and the seperate toilet is a bummer. It‚Äôs very small and messy when you wash your hands. I barely managed."
"WE WERE ROBBED! We booked this apartment for a week and a few days in we were robbed of all of our valuables ($10,000+ worth of computers, headphones, luggage, passports, medicines and so on) by someone who HAD A KEY to the apartment. The majority of our time in Paris was spent dealing with this issue. The host refused to help with the police and insisted that we not tell the police it was an Airbnb. She refused to meet with the police or even drive into Paris. As a result, my family had to deal with the crime scene (finger printing), meeting with the locksmith multiple times, hours at the police station, cleaning up from the vandals and countless follow-ups with authorities. The host will NOT PROVIDE us with her insurance information for our claim and has been incredibly rude throughout the process. She literally had nothing stolen. She has harassed us via phone, texts and emails at all hours of the day. She has hung up the phone on us and refused to help. Eventually, it got so bad that we just left the apartment and booked somewhere else. Even after we left, she harassed us saying we took her key which we did not.  I can't believe Airbnb will let her rent to people."
"This location is spectacular! Less than one block from a metro station and on a major bus line! two cafes less than a block away. Within a block or two are a grocery store, a cheese shop, butcher shop, fruit stands, excellent chocolate shops, wine shops and grocery stores that sell wine. The post office and a Laundromat were across the street. Very safe and totally convenient!"
"The communication with the guest Olivier was perfect, in spite I was not speaking French and the way to find the keys was good. Everything was well explained in the apartment and nice to have the first breakfast offered. The apartment was as large enough to well stay in 4 and very quite in spite of train passing close and the traffic in the street. Unfortunately the surroundings are rough, feeling of no safety is evident, confirmed by two (unsuccessful) attempt of pickpocketing in spite we were on the alert. Maybe could be common around railway stations in big cities (Gare du Nord is close) but at least not the best for families."
"Capicine‚Äôs apartment was perfect for our stay - it felt very homely and quintessentially Parisian. It was well located - a 10 min walk into the thriving Belleville neighborhood or a 10 min metro into town (the metro station was only 2 mins away!). The apartment was super cosy and homely - not very big but well decorated with a Christmas tree and fitted with a kitchen and a washer/dryer so we felt right at home and were able to cook and wash our clothes. It also had heating and air con which was very handy in the cold weather. The stairs can be a lot if you‚Äôre not very fit/used to them, but we didn‚Äôt find them too bad and it‚Äôs very standard for a 5th floor Parisian apartment, so no complaints. The only improvement would be the water pressure and the shower - it took ages to heat up, and one day stopped working completely, and the water pressure was not good, we didn‚Äôt really feel like we took a ‚Äòproper‚Äô shower for the whole stay, but it was fine for a few days. Overall was great!"
"It is not a place for 3 people to stay in. The sofa bed is extremely uncomfortable (DONT BOOK THIS AIRBNB IF YOU ARE 3). It needs maintenance and cleaning. The location is really great, 5 minute walk from the Eiffel Tower and there is a metro station near the apartment as well.  We had to keep the window open when we were there because the bad smell of the apartment is contained. There is no air conditioning, not sure how to stay there when it‚Äôs July and it‚Äôs almost 40 degrees.  If you use the hot water to bathe, you run out of electricity, and you have to move the electricity plugs until it works. There is no soap to wash dishes or an iron for our clothes (the host response was that we already knew what was on the apartment because of the list of amenities in the Airbnb site)."
"This place is all about location. You‚Äôre within a 5-10 minute walk from the Eiffel Tower, and even less from a Metro station.  The apartment is on the 4th floor with no elevator, so prepare for the hike. It was unseasonably hot in Paris while we were visiting, and the apartment was miserably hot. There are no fans, and there‚Äôs also a great deal of construction going on outside making it hard to leave the windows open and try to sleep."
"< strengths > 1. near by the station 2. provide me the late checkout for me who hurt my ankle. < weakness > 1. The bathroom drain was full of hair. 2. The bed smelled like a man. 3. There was only a sofa bed. 4. there is a washer but no laundry detergent. 5. He was  a very inexperienced host for me. I was told checkout process. but it was not enough up. It‚Äôs result that there was miscommunication when it comes to retuning a key. So I had to go back to the room again. Thanks to you, I missed my flight."
"The Apartment is at the ground floor, it has two bedrooms and a living room with a sofabed and kitchen corner. One of the bedrooms has no window, the other has a small window situated on the higher part of the wall. The living room has a skylight located at the top. . The location is close to the metro station and short walking distance to restaurants, brasseries, boulangerie and pharmacies."
"I'm not someone that gives bad reviews usually,but this time I had to. The apartment was really dirty, clearly some general cleaning was done,but it's not enough. The shelves were dirty,the curtain shower was old and dirty and the oven was absolutely horrible. The blanket on the bed is actually small for a king's bed, luckily there is heating in the loft.Unfortunately the heaters weren't clean and since I am allergic to dust,I had a very unpleasant night of sleep,also the mattress is really hard,not comfortable for everyone. On a positive note, the apartment is very well positioned, near to 3 metro station and in a street full of restaurants and shops and the apartment has a washer and dryer which is very useful."
"To say something good first. the metro station is near and there are resaturant and supermarket nearby. Then say something important. It is a terriable experance living in the room and I have not met the room like this before, never ever. I was given the key for the flat but there was no key for the room, it made us uncomfortable and unsafe. There was no bedquilt, we went to bed with all clothes we could wear because it was a little cold at night. and it was very unacceptable that there were lots of belongs in the room like someone just leave the room, no matter what it is not a room for a guess. I demand to cancle the reservation but rejected, though the rules said that it is flexable to cancle the room. We did not get the bedquilt eaven after I told the host we need it. It is no use to complain to the customer service. It seems that only terrible dirty can cancel the room, this is the only demand the company reguate the host?"
1 block away from Eiffel Tower and metro station
Pros: 1. The building is very close to metro station from where you can get metro 2 and 4.  2. Building has elevator but it is very small. Can only take 2 ppl and a bag at one time.  Problems:  1. Bath room door doesn‚Äôt have any lock . no privacy 2. Toilet area has just one small curtain that can provide hardly any front coverage and open on one side.  3. There is a big glass window right next to shower without any curtain. Shower is not large enough for you to put on cloths. There are buildings around. very difficult and uncomfortable  4. We had our initial reservation for 3 folks and had a 6 year old child. Host msged for 40 euros additional on msg as we had 4 in our group. I immediately agreed and offered to pay in cash. Host said ok but later msged to pay through Airbnb and said will cancel my stay if I didn‚Äôt pay by evening. I msged Airbnb support to understand how to pay. Kept host updated on all progress.Wasn‚Äôt provided iron that I requested in advance and host had acknowledged
The place is located in a good location walkable distance to Blanche metro station .  The room is not fully accessible by lift we need to carry luggage one floor up through narrow stairs . The house is spacious but the kitchen utensils and washing machine were not clean.
"The view was incredible and one of the highlights of our trip. Its close to restaurants and bars, and multiple metro stations. It had all the amenities we could want. My only criticism is that the bed and sofa bed were not very comfortable."
"The bedroom is too small to live we even can‚Äôt find a place to open our luggage, the bathroom is too small and without any air conditioner, in summer it‚Äôs even hotter than outside. But the staff worked there were nice . The location is not so good, but near the metro station."
"A spectacular view of Paris from a large terrace, shame about the cockroach infested apartment and unwarranted flooding accusations by the owner.  On the third evening of our six night stay the first cockroaches appeared and their numbers increased each evening. We dreaded returning to the flat as there was no relaxation or sleep until we had spent an hour or more killing off the cockroaches. Clearly not a pleasant way to end a day spent in Paris. We informed the owner immediately and she admitted that it was an on going problem within the building. However, after following up with photos and stating we had found one wandering across a closed suitcase she insinuated that we had brought the cockroaches with us, who would do that ?  The owner offered to treat the problem on the 4th day after initially refusing to admit there was an infestation. However, we hoped this could wait until our departure as cockroach treatment makes them more active. This was evident on Saturday evening when the apartment had been treated and the owner finally offered to repay us for our last night if we could find somewhere else to stay. This was an offer that came too late! If we had known about the buildings issues we would not have booked this Airbnb. In all, we killed 25 cockroaches in 4 days but that was only part of the problem.  On the day we arrived the caretaker advised us of a minor water leak under the sink that had as yet not been resolved. A bucket had been placed under the sink pipe work which had also been sealed with white silicone. Apart from not being able to close the cupboard below the sink we thought no more of it, until we arrived home and received a demand from the owner for ‚Ç¨2000 as compensation for not informing her of the leak which led to flooding and possible lifting of the wood flooring. When we did finally leave Paris early Sunday morning the only thing we left behind on the wood floors were dead cockroaches.  After many wonderful stays in Airbnb locations around the world and receiving outstanding reviews, I feel it is only right to forewarn others that are considering staying here. The cockroaches and insane accusations are something I hope never to encounter again."
"Aris was very friendly but the place was broken into within hours of our arrival. Our laptops were stolen, our suitcases had been gone through.  We spend the next day at the police station and our Paris-weekend was ruined. Aris refunded us in full and was extremely friendly - but nonetheless our experience was terrible due to being robbed. "
"My husband, three year old and I stayed at Valerie's place for eight days. The apartment is walking distance to train station Joffin, and some restaurants/bars. However, it is wise to note that most food establishments are closed on Sundays and Mondays outside of the center of Paris. There is a supermarket, pizza hut, and wine shops nearby.  You have to walk up five flights on winding steps to get to the apartment which is on the 5th floor (Parisians refer to it as the 4th because they count the main floor as zero) The stairs are uncomfortable to walk up when carrying luggage, or if traveling with a child. There is no lift.  The bed is loft-like, and not safe for children. Neighbors are a little noisy at times so if you're looking to sleep in, forget it.  If you don't expect much, and aren't planning on staying indoors much, then for the price‚Äìit's ok. "
This place was definitely very cute. It states that it can hold up to seven people but I would not recommend to have a full group of seven. It was smaller than how the pictures look. The cleaning fee they ask if u want to include might not be worth is because dishes aren‚Äôt included in the cleaning fee. Personally I don‚Äôt make a mess anywhere I stay except for dishes when traveling so in my opinion paying that cleaning fee was not worth it at all. However it was located close to the train station which was very convenient.
"This place was cute but a little disappointing. When we arrived, we were given the incorrect codes to get in, and were locked out for about 20 minutes on the street with all of our luggage. The room is tiny and half of the bed is unusable because of the angled ceiling. The shower did not drain even after it was supposedly fixed by the housekeeper. Also, the TV had issues and had to be rebooted but was still not working. In addition, a man came to the door to install a water meter early in the morning and insisted on coming inside. We had no heads up he would be arriving. The location was decent because it was close to the metro stations but a little far from the city attractions. "
"The location is not bad. But, I had to go two metro stations away to get the key, which was very inconvenient and difficult for a traveler with a lot of luggage. I also had to go back to return the key. The room was clean and conveniently equipped with kitchen utensils, washing machine, etc. but the wifi didn't connect at first, so I had to contact them and plug in myself. Worst of all, there was very weak sound proofing next door, so I could hear the baby crying all night. The bathroom had hot water but there was dirty on the toilet paper and towels and it was very unpleasant. I decided to come here because the room was pretty from the pictures, but it was not as clean as the pictures. It was nice to see the church from the window. There was no room in the freezer, and the room smelled of an unknown strong detergent.  I spent a lot of money for good memories in paris but i couldn't with this logement."
"Mauds place is central to everything in Paris, The Louvre is across the road with Louvre-Rivoli and Halles Metro stations a block or so away. You really feel you are living like a Parisian in this apartment."
"Location is conveniently located near Gare Du Nord station. There is no lift getting up to level 3 of this apartment, so something to note for those who carrying heavy luggage. Overall, a decent stay for us."
"We arrived late at the Airbnb. Amy had prepared very clear instructions for self-check in. The Airbnb was easy to find, just next to the RER B Gentilly station. It was easy to walk to Cit√© Universitaire via the bridge across the p√©riph√©rique (though the closest bridge closes at night). The apartment itself was as shown on the pictures. The furniture was outdated. The little light switches were hard to find at night. The lightning in the living room was insufficient. We didn't use the kitchen, but it seemed to have the basics (even some spices!) which is uncommon enough to be noted. Everything was clean. The apartment overlooked a small and quiet parking. The curtains were letting a lot of light through so could be an issue in summer. The main downside of the apartment is the very poor isolation with neighbor apartments (mostly above). We could hear very loud bangs at night a few times, once waking both of us very suddenly."
"We got a terrible check-in experience, which was probably our bad luck, but anyway, it spoiled the entire experience. The apartment can be noisy at night with all the underground trains passing by as it's located between 2 metro stations, so if you're a sensitive sleeper, please be aware of that. There is a windowed wall between one of the bedrooms and the living room, which may also be a problem for some people. The staircase to the 1st floor (American second) is quite tricky, so any big language may be a problem.  The street in front of the building is pretty busy, also at night, so you may not like that either. All in all, we wouldn't recommend it, probably."
"Georges' studio was only 1 block away from a metro station so the whole city was easily accessible. There were lots of stores on the street where you can buy groceries, wine, cheese, baguettes, etc. It was only a few blocks form the Canal St. Martin where there were lots of bistros and cafes. It was also quiet at night which was a real plus for me."
"It‚Äôs a convenient place, near restaurants, metro station, supermarkets... but it is a little bit noisy."
"Small, clean apartment in a great location, very close to the Eiffel Tower and metro stations. Detailed communication, with clear check-in instructions. Fine for a short trip, but no hand-soap was provided and the tap in the bathroom was broken."
"Some of the facilities were damaged which was not shown in any of the photos (e.g. broken toilet seat and peeling wallpaper), also only two pillows provided for four people. Location was good - right next to a metro station and no loud noise at night."
I had no issues staying at Estella's place. No issues with check-in and check-out. No communication issues - no problems encountered. The bed was firm - perfect for us. The location of Estella's place was really convenient - 2-3 mins walk to Gare de Lyon - a very well connected metro station. Despite its location it was quiet. It has all the basics and I would recommend her place if you have a short time in Paris. 
"As reviewed in the past, the location is wonderful. Metro station is 3 minutes walk away, and Bus stop to some destination is 1 minute walk from the flat. The flat is clean and well decorated. Sarah is so kind and replied promptly every time. But it was so terrible for us that Wi-fi and internet connection are completely broken and not in use. It should be informed in advance, especially for the tourist from the other country. But excluding that point, the flat would be almost perfect for the tourists to stay some days in Paris."
Pro: location is convenient to various subway stations. But the area is loud. Con: 1. Very dirty! Very run down! I did not feel clean. Wet laundry was in the washing machine when I arrived. Parts of the house smells like cat pee and the whole place smells like unclean cat litter. (I have cats and love cats but this is not clean for an Airbnb) 2. The shower was not hot enough. Shower floor was very dirty looking.  3. The pictures look a lot bigger than reality. 4. The place doesn‚Äôt have iron and shampoo like the description. The host dropped off soap later when I communicated but it was not shampoo but soap.  Overall really hated my stay here and would not recommend.
"The host is very nice and waited for me until a bit late. However, I don't recommend using the metro to get there, especially if you are with bags. Besides the fact that the isn't escalators in a lot of the metro stations, when I arrive at the station near the apartment, a guy attempted to steal my cellphone."
It's an ok place for one or two nights. Good central location. Good for Opera M and for RER. BUT the key pick up isn't ideal if you are on your own or NOT arriving at Opera Metro station where the key is located. About a 7 minute walk from the apartment to collect - and return. If you have suitcases it's a nightmare. Marie can meet you at the property with the key but unless you arrive within minutes of your suggested arrival time - she's gone! We were 15 minutes late having advised we were driving 5 hours from Annecy.
"The location of the apartment was wonderful, very close walk to 2 metro stations. The apartment was large but not overly clean. The only major problem was that the shower heads were broken and the toilet didn't flush consistently."
"The place is near Victor Hugo station, which is a plus. But it's not near to champs eelyees nor other major tourist sights by foot. The room is too small for two persons.  Toilet is very small and cramp, and the only window there was blocked. Wouldn't return here again."
"This has literally been my worst experience with Airbnb. My money got stolen from my locked suitcase from inside the room. My suitcase lock was tempered and my entire stack of cash was gone. Keeping this experience discreetly aside, the place is well located in a happening neighbourhood and very close to 2 metro stations. I had all positive things to say about the place until I found that my money went missing from the room."
Apartment was exactly as described in listing. Door was a little hard to figure out how to open in the beginning but that was the only negative. Apartment was quiet and very clean. Area was close to two metro stations and lots of places to eat and drink nearby. Would stay again.
"The Batchelor sweet is in a really great location, it has restaurants,  cafes, shops and the metro is so close.  The room is small and when the bed is out you have minimal room between the bed and wall.  Their was construction abouve the room and it started at 6:30 am every morning except on sunday. The room was dirty in areas, the shelves had previouse cup stains and vents had a film of furry dust. I did a wipe down and everythibg was good. Its a cute place, it has no air conditioning and was hot, your on the 1st floor and the windows open to a courtyard which you cant leave windows open if your away  as someone can walk through the window into the place.  Their is a fan but when i stayed it was 26 - 30 Celsius and the roo  didnt cool down. Their is no luggage service or accommodations to store your bags befor or after check in, i had to use the bus station as they have extended hour's  to hold bags for as low as 5.50."
"The apartment is very well located: near to metro and RER station (great for those who want to go to Disney). The check-in and check-out where very easy and convenient, as we were able to leave the luggage in the apartment before the check-in time and leave a little bit later than the check-out time. However, the appliances and furniture in the apartment are very old and/or are broken (i.e., the dresser where the bed linen and towels are stored is broken, leaving everything exposed), there is no curtain in one of the bedrooms window, letting the sun come in early in the morning, and there is no curtain in the bathtub either, making the entire bathroom wet when taking a shower (it was a bit stressful to take showers, actually, as there was no shower holder either). In summary: the apartment is OK for short stays where you are not going to spend a lot of time indoors."
"Apartment near the bus stations but a little far from the metro. Well decorated but not very clean space, there were hair on the bathroom floor. There were no bath towels available. The owner ordered me to use the old ones in the wardrobe, but they were not dry and smelled bad. In addition to being old and with many stains. I had problems with the owner when I questioned about the cleanliness of the bathroom and the lack of bath towels, they were not attentive. At the first contact she gave me the option to send a woman to clean, but I was not in the apartment, and when I asked the second time she no longer offered me this option and began to be hostile. One day I answered an email at 2 AM when I got home and the other day she replied complaining about the time and that I had woken her up.  Aibnb advises to send emails for communication and message or WhatsApp only when it is urgent.  That's why I didn't send a message but an email. I short, not comfortable space and not caring owner."
"The location is not the best, you can come across with beggers and sketchy people not necessarly they hurt you but you just feel uncomfortable. The apartment is meant to be for 4 people, however the bathroom (sink area) is even very small for two people. The sheets were missing for the couch. The beddings were not the best. The unit is fully renovated so you wouldn‚Äôt see anything broken or damaged. If you wanna have a budget stay and still being close to subway station you can give a shot."
"the place is nice, but it could have been tidier for how expensive it was. there is a metro station 5 blocks away."
"Nicely located (shops, restaurants, metro) and well-equipped apartment, but a little cozy for more than 4 people and filled with the private stuff of the owner. There's no affordable long-term parking option in the neighborhood, we had to rent a garage one metro station away."
"Moira's apartment was lovely. The pictures are an exact portrayal of what you can expect. It was clean, trendy, and had all the amenities to make our stay possible without having to bring everything from home. Moira was very hospitable, accommodating, professional, and quick to communicate. We arrived in Paris early in the morning and she arranged for us to pick up the key from her friend even though should couldn't be there in person which made our arrival much more comfortable since we were so exhausted from our flight.  Her apartment is only a brief walk uphill to Montmartre and Sacre Coure, however, the neighborhood was not ideal. While we felt safe and at home in her apartment, the street was endlessly noisy with cars and sirens sounding throughout the night. Bring earplugs if you are not used to sleeping in a very noisy neighborhood. We began the trip using the subway from the Barbes station as our main form of transportation, but quickly switched to using Uber in order to avoid the busy and stressful commute in and out of the train station. Be very careful of the pickpockets that frequent the local area and avoid traveling to or from the nearby train stations during rush hour or at night at all costs. The pro's: Moira is a great host. The apartment is just like the pictures. The wifi worked perfectly. The water pressure in the shower was great. The con's: The neighborhood was loud, busy, scary at times, and lacked the Parisian charm. The mattress was uneven (ok for one person, but potentially uncomfortable for two)."
"Nice area and close to metro station. Place is fine but nothing special, good if you don‚Äôt plan on spending much down time there. Restaurant directly below can be noisy on weekend nights but otherwise is fine."
"Mercedes did address our problems in a prompt way, but they could have been avoided if there were explicit instructions by email before arriving. After we complained, she sent Ellis in person to correct the problems. The vestibule code did not work for us and someone let us in.  We had no initial instruction on locating the lock box with the keys. When trying to log into the internet, the instructions in a frame on the living room wall were totally wrong, and no TV instructions, so, NO  TV and no internet until she sent Ellis to help! No instructions on how to turn on the heater or the air conditioners and none on how to throw out the trash!  We learned from others you had to 33 Rue Faidherbe, take the elevator to floor -1 to the basement to find the trash bins. We also were never given the intercom code for guests coming to visit. We had an infestation of bugs called ‚Äúpoisson d'argent"" in the 2 bathrooms and she sent exterminators. Pans and window -filthy.  Sofas cushionless!"
"We stayed in this apartment for a week in February 2014. Claire was very accommodating, meeting us in the morning so we could drop off our luggage early. The water heater was broken upon our arrival, but Claire got it fixed within a day and even opened up her own shower for our use in the meantime.  The location of the apartment was very convenient for us. It's very close to both Bastille and Saint-Paul M√©tro stations. In addition, there are many stores on Rue St Antoine, including a Monoprix about 5 mins walk away. Definitely no problems getting anything you need.  The washroom is small but usable, as others have mentioned, it's not particularly private so anything going on inside will be heard by anyone else in the apartment.  No problems with the sleeping area - we knew it was a loft from the pictures and didn't find the climb up to the bed annoying or difficult.  Kitchen was basic but we didn't do any cooking so it wasn't an issue for us. There was a kettle for morning coffee or tea, which was sufficient for our needs.  Overall, it was a pleasant stay and we would definitely consider staying there again the next time we are in Paris."
"The location of this Airbnb was amazing - it is a 2 minute walk from the Bastille metro station and the street has a ton of cute boutiques and restaurants. We would stay here again because of the location. As for the apartment, it is as described and definitely an efficient use of space (fine for two people but a bit cozy) and the loft bed is not great for a tall person. The only complaint is that the bathroom is tiny - if you are a tall person, this apartment is not for you but it worked great for us. We would stay again!"
"The apartment was not clean, although the cleaning costs are included in the price of the apartment. So, we couldn't feel at home at all and we didn't enjoy our stay there. The location was good, near metro station in a quiet neighborhood."
"The apartment is conveniently located near a metro station, the kitchen is well-equipped, with a big table, and there's a decent TV set with Netflix, YouTube, etc. However, there were some issues that impacted our stay. The biggest one we faced was with the hot water supply. It turned out to be limited by default, and we were not aware of this before running out of hot water in the morning. Although the host eventually provided a workaround, it took several hours to fix, which disrupted our plans for the day. In addition, the bathroom was quite cold, and the bed was a bit creaky, the white towels provided had some minor stains, and there was no hanging space in the only guest closet, only shelves."
"great location in front of the station. fast check in. it is called ‚Äòbed and breakfast‚Äô but somehow breakfast is not included and if you want it you have to pay 8‚Ç¨ each (bad coffee, poor variety of food). decent bedroom but very uncomfortable mattress. you get what you paid for!"
"We are a senior couple. The flat is comfortable, on the first floor  (2nd floor North American), no elevator which wasn't really needed. There  is no air conditioning, but there are fans. It's situated on a busy pedestrian street, near the Centre Pompidou. A metro station is two blocks away. The heavy windows block out all the noise at night, making for a comfortable sleep. I would stay there again."
"The apartment was very cozy, within a close proximity to a Metro station and surrounded by a multitude of amenities. However, we did notice a few holes in the walls covered with paper and the kitchen missed utensil (i.e. there was no oven glove and I had to purchase a spatula). We had a few problems with the WiFi and hot water, but the host quick to respond to our messages and assist us."
"I stayed on the first floor and I didn‚Äôt sleep at all. There appears to be some sort of rat infestation because all night I heard scratching at the walls and ceiling and even squeaking in the vents. At 3am I went to speak with the concierge and he came into my room and the noise quieted down since rats and mice usually quiet down when they hear noise. I tried playing rat repellent noises from online and that helped a bit, but all in all it was really difficult to sleep. I slept probably 2 hours max because I thought a rat would come to my bed in the middle of the night."
"We rented the apartment, in a building with character, for a midweek in May. There's a lot of space in the homely, big livingroom, and a garden in the back. We could conveniently (un)load the car in the court. It's really quiet, no traffic noise. And if you want to read a (french) book, no problem! The house is very close to the subway station Alexandre Dumas, and the busstop to Bastille and the Louvre. Two supermarkets and two bakery's are very close. Isabelle is very nice and helpful and only a phonecall away. In spite of her son's broken leg, two days before our arrival, she didn't even cancel the reservation. Our teenage girls and we loved Paris in spring, and the apartment!"
"Basically what you see on photos it's what you get.  Negative things: 1.- You have to think it twice to take a shower on that bathroom, very small and dirty. 2.- The flat it's on the 6th floor, sounds easy but let's better take a deep breath! 3.- There's no WiFi. 4.- You have to take a long walk to a near ""metro"" station or bus stop.  And Finally the owner lives in the front door, but that's not helpfull at all eventhough when the old lock of the old door stop working and you have to manage yourself to try to open the door plus you have to pay for it.  I think Mr. David shouldn't rent his flat with that attitude. There's always the option of sell or rent it, but just to one person... I dont know im just giving some ideas because it's not nice being treated like that. "
"The location is amazing !  We walked everywhere , only used metro once . metro and train stations are very close. Apartment was small, clean and cozy, perfect for couple or solo traveler.  Disadvantages : neighbours was loud and we heared every step they made, that was annoying. Sound isolation is very , very Poor .  And also - I suggest you to change sofa to bed, because sofa cracked a lot and that was so annoying at night ."
"The location was good‚Äîclose to a metro station and walkable to the Eiffel tower, which allowed us to see a lot in just a few days. Check-in, however, was very frustrating. The host sent a link to a 3rd-party check-in, which provided us with the wrong door code and then the host provided us with a second wrong door code. (After spending several minutes on hold with the 3rd-party company we finally were given instructions for how to get a physical key.) The same thing happened to two other groups on our floor. The unit itself is fine‚Äîlots of natural light‚Äîthough a little noisy."
Very close to jourdain metro station. Was happy with the clean bathroom  and almost new kitchen. But the sofa bed was not comfortable.
"Very close to metro & bus stations, restaurants and shops. Apartment is for one person. Has everything to make your stay more pleasant but try not to carry big suitcases, it is a fifth floor with no elevator and narrow stairs."
5 mins walk to nearest metro station here. Spacious roomsÔºå sufficient bathrooms. The only thing that we worried about was the property located on ground floor and next to sidewalk.
"The flat is well located and only 20 minutes by taxi from the main train station- Gare Du Nord. The area around is bustling and only a 20 to 30 minute walk from the Louvre. There is also a metro stop nearby. Area around the flat has lots of options for restaurants and bars. Although none stood out as particularly exceptional.  The building itself is located in a quiet street which is mostly residential but also has some commercial. Worth bearing in mind that the flat is on the third floor with no lifts.  Check-in is very well coordinated, with access to the key made possible through a lock box outside the flat.  The flat itself is a decent size, well lit and generally quite clean. Though the bathroom is not great - very tight squeeze and the shower area is in need of a thorough cleaning.  My only other complaint is that the duvet was dirty and without a cover. We did feel the need for it during our stay, but hesitated to use it due to its condition.  Overall, I think the flat is practical and convenient but quite basic and I did not feel I got value for my money. This is a flat you would book knowing that you would want to spend as little time in as possible."
"Nice centrally located place. Easy access to everywhere and the station (very close to Eurostar).  Some issues though: The heaters didn't work well though so the place was very cold. There was a weird smell in the bathroom and the wine bottle opener was a very cheap one that broke when we used it so we had to go buy one. Overall not a bad stay, but some small things were a bit disappointing."
"I do not recommend staying here. During my stay, there was construction going on in the apartment downstairs that would literally shake the entire apartment, not to mention the noise. The hot water stopped working during this time and wasn't restored for at least 2 days. Cleanliness There were two broken light fixtures. The toilet seat was not connected to the toilet (and couldn't be repaired). The shower liner was not secured properly and water would leak from the shower on use. There was sand-like dirt in the corner of the room by the window. Accuracy The apartment was small, but it aligned with the ad. Check-in / check-out Pierre was unable to meet during check-in, but the meeting with the building manager went smoothly. For check-out, Pierre and I were supposed to meet, but he did not show up before I needed to leave for my flight. Communication Pierre would take a while to communicate, which was especially bad when the hot water went out. However, he resolved the hot water issue and the construction issue 2-3 days after I contacted him. Location The apartment is very close to Bastille, which is a popular area in Paris.  There are some restaurants and many fast food places (which may appeal to some people, but I preferred to eat better, especially since it is not practical to cook in the apartment).  The biggest problem with location was that it is on a rather small side street right off the main plaza and drunk people would come down the street to pee and throw up, leaving all sorts of unpleasant odors. There is also the back entrance to a seafood restaurant on the block, which also does not smell great. There is a Velib station right on the corner."
"Strategic location, well equipped studio. Host is good, able to wait for us for late check in ( we check in at 11pm).  For lone traveller especially ladies has to be careful. This area is not so safe, we experienced snatch case during the 1st night arrival near station. Although the snatched was not successful, but it has made us phobia and not to go out during night time. "
"I would recommend this place if you have not need for a kitchen. The location is great, we were two adults and two kids and another adult/child could easily fit without feeling crammed. Great location with multiple metro stations close by. Rooms and bathroom are spacious and clean, beautifully decorated,  surprisingly large for Paris standards. Great restaurants around (we loved Ober Mama which is around the corner), bakeries, grocery store. Very quiet at night with windows facing courtyard, we slept with windows open and barely heard city noises (just a bit on Saturday night). We had limited access to the kitchen as this was the owner's private home and we did not want to be disruptive.  One significant frustration was regarding our arrival, we were not given the correct address and climbed three flights of stairs with luggage, kids and an elderly person only to realize we were in the wrong building when someone offered to call for us. As international travelers we did not have cell service which made this lack of communication especially frustrating. The address on the AirBnB page is not correct. This was not communicated by the host at any point during our multiple exchanges prior to our visit and no apology was offered.  Also, there are other guests on the house, one of whom entered our rooms at 1am by mistake (because the lock on the back door was not working - it was repaired during the last day of our stay). While this was an innocent mistake it was nonetheless disruptive and, again, no apology was offered by the host.  "
Location is good as it is a walking distance from main stations. However the apartment is very small. 2 people cannot walk in the corridor at the same time. Main door cannot open completely because of space constraint. There was some sort of smell in the apartment which we didn't like. There wasn't a bed cover on the sofa cum bed and it was not in good condition. we were not informed in beginning about the presence pet in the house which we didn't liked. there was someone who came to look for the cat but she didn't find her and wasted some 30 minutes of ours. i would not suggest this for family. 
"Apartment as in the description.  Located close to metro and bus stations.  Although the apartment is small, like all in Paris, it is enough for what is required: to stay a few days in the city.  As I mentioned to the host, it is necessary to check the sofa bed because it might not be comfortable to sleep on, I think that the use of it has caused some springs to not be in place."
"The apartment is very beautiful. The facility is great, only unfortunately it was not very clean. The street and nearby metro station does not look very trustworthy. But you are quickly out of this dubious corner."
"Doris was flexible, responsive, and very helpful. Her small apartment is three blocks from the Pigalle metro station and is sometimes noisy.  The layout is not optimal. The bunk bed is in a passageway between the kitchen and the apartment's only bathroom.  To reach the bathroom, one has to navigate around the bunk bed while attempting not to collide with its metal ladder. Our 12-year-old was often awakened by the sound of an adult stumbling into the ladder in the middle of the night, followed by curses directed at said ladder, followed by bathroom sounds -- even when the clothes-washer in the kitchen did not beep all night for reasons unknown.  There were other oddities.  There is no clothes dryer and the hang-drying of clothes in the apartment is not permitted.  The coffee-maker accepts only a non-standard kind of espresso capsule not found in Montmartre. There is limited closet space.   We think that the apartment might be suitable for two people who do not mind its quirks."
"Pros: Pictures and description are accurate.  Ledru-Rollin metro station is right outside. Combo washer/dryer is convenient--but dryer takes a long time and you should only load halfway All electric outlets have USB-A sockets Monoprix across the street, and outdoor market five min walk away Cons: Street can be noisy at night, so if you're a light sleeper this may be a problem Flat is up three flights of stairs which may be problematic for people with bad knees Overall I felt the place was a great choice and I enjoyed my stay with one big caveat: we returned early one afternoon to find a handyman inside replacing burned out lights. The host did not inform us about this in advance or ask if it was okay. We had all our stuff laying around and I felt it a big intrusion on privacy. Our personal belongings were not moved and nothing was taken (including large amounts of cash left lying out on a table) but it still did not feel appropriate. If we hadn't come back when we did we would never have known it had happened. That made me wonder what I might see every time I returned after that."
"Hugue was very accommodating with letting us drop off bags and leave them - (odd checkin & out hours) this is their private home so has all of there personal belonging in cupboards bathroom shower kitchen fridge etc...  very very squeaky floors and subway underneath to shakes very often linen certainly needs to be updated, sheets worn to holing and towels very old and hard good location to train station and cafes  no washing machine, microwave or iron available no linen provided for bed in lounge"
"One of the worst flats where we stayed. Actually it's not so bad , but in real life it's much smaller then on the photos. The flat was uncleared ‚Äì everything was in dust (what was a problem the first day because I'm allergic) and the dishes and glasses were dirty. It was a surprise because cleaning fee was included to the bill we payed. The bathroom and the toilet are very small, (and uncleaned) there also a problem with a lock in the toilet. There're no hangers for the clothes, so if you have big luggage with sweaters/dresses/or anything that you want to hang be ready to leave them in your bag. Hooks are inconvenient for the towels because they always fell down from them. Wi-fi in the bedroom worked intermittently.   But there were also pluses - good bed, cool TV, underground stations are 2 minutes walk, supermarket is close to the apartment"
"Hadrien's place was conveniently located -- right across the street from the Montparnasse train station yet in a building that isolated the apartment from the noise and chaos of the station outside. It's within walking distance to a bunch of places to eat and drink too. Inside, the apartment was very spacious for my girlfriend and I. It probably would work well for up to four, although perhaps not ideal in that situation since the shower/bath is in a room between the bedroom and the living room. As a host, Hadrien was very helpful and gave us instructions for everything in the apartment when we entered. Great stay, thanks again Hadrien!"
"A genuine Parisian apartment with eclectic furnishings. Close to the Gare du Nord, bus stops and metro stations. Half hour by metro into the centre and almost an hour by bus. Walkable to Montmatre."
"The location is nice but the place is hard to get into; very small elevator as well. There was no space at all anywhere around the apartment, no empty closets no room to use for any personal things. And the host cloth, personal belongings were everywhere around the apartment. Couldn‚Äôt really use any space and had to leave my suitcase in living room.  The floor made a lot of noise while walking on it which caused a lot of disturbance.  I left with some things in the kitchen sink and the host requested a refund because I didn‚Äôt put them in the washing machine ( which was full with old things)  All in all was nice to spend 2 days between trips as it‚Äôs close to the train station. But I won‚Äôt recommend for long stays on its current situation."
"Between Metro stations, bars, and proximity to Montmartre, the location is perfect. The apartment was clean and cozy and the host was very quick to respond to all our messages. Sadly, there were issues that diminished our experience. The guest guidebook wasn't entirely up-to-date. The wifi password was incorrect, and the key instructions did not account for the drop-off place being closed. The biggest problem, however, concerned the key at our check-in and check-out. The host knew about our time of arrival, but when we got there, the key wasn't there. The host then had a backup key delivered which added an hour to check-in. When we checked out on time, the drop off location was closed and the first alternative was not a viable solution.  Overall, we would recommend the apartment itself wholehartedly, but the circumstances made significant parts of our stay somewhat exhausting and unpleasant."
"Flat was within walking distance to bus stop Pont Neuf and close to metro station.  Many restaurants and veggie/fruit stand nearby.  Flat was clean, clean linens and towels.  Able to use kitchen (we didn't).  Photos are accurate.   No info given on using the fobs to get in main entrance and glass door.  No info given on pushing button to unlock glass door.  If using the pull out sofa be aware that it blocks the flat's door.  If an emergency, you need to close sofa back up to get out, and emergency personnel (police, paramedics...) can't come in if sofa is pulled out in use."
"The place is fine. But not more than it promises. It is close to a metrostation and has several groceryshops close by. It's a place to stay and sleep, if you want to stay in Paris relatively cheap. The double bed is over the actual flat and has a low ceiling. The last bed is situated ""on ground floor"" and is not super comfortable."
"The apartment is nice and close to a metro station and a canal. There are some really cool restaurants within 10 minute's walk. Check-in was easy. Communication with the host was easy too.  However, the hallway always had an unacceptable smell, which was very unpleasant. There were possibly some issues with the building's sewerage system too. Whenever someone flushed the toilet in the apartment directly above this apartment, there was a terrible smell for a couple of minutes in this apartment's toilet. That was very uncomfortable. We stayed there for two days only and not sure if that was a rare occurrence. I guess the hosts can't do much to directly address these issues other than maybe communicating with the building management."
"We are 4 people of a family group. This accommodation has excellent location, 5 min walk to the Pompidou art centre and convenient to reach the metro station. The block is quite in the evening. For the whole property was okay, description was correct but the light in one of bedroom was weak. The host promised to fix it but never showed up. There has some problem with the shower‚Äôs sink which was completely clogged and we have to take shower in the bath tub."
"I lived here for a month. House is lovely and quite. Also bathroom has shower booth that's the part i like the most. But location is not good. Around the nearest station would be dangerous. Especially you don't have company i don't recommend.üò¢ But anything except that, perfact."
"I only stayed a few days and nights in Paris to explore. The nearby Metrostations made it very easy to travel around. The communication was quick and nice. I arrived quite late, but had no problems to check in. As mentioned by others it's a small private apartment with not much room to unpack, which was no problem at all for my short stay. :)"
"Ben provided good instructions for checking in. The apartment is in a nice area and near to the metro station. In general the place was okay to sleep at, however, our experience with the kitchen was bad. The stove didn‚Äôt heat properly, despite being on the highest setting. We had bought groceries and unfortunately we couldn‚Äôt cook them. We also tried to use the laundry machine which did not work for us. One of the beds was smaller than expected and uncomfortable. The internet was fast."
"Great location. Supermarket just across the road! 5 mins walk to Trocadero metro station. However the house is not in great condition. Dishwasher was not working. There was no shower gel, shampoo or washing powder for clothes although there was a Washing Machine in the house. Only 1 toilet paper roll was available. We had to purchase all the above items for our 4 day stay. Overall 3/5"
"The reviews and pictures are 7 years old. The apartment is much more cluttered and doesn't match the photos. The location is great. Close to Poissonni√®re metro station. The bedding and towels were clean Cleanliness is not even close to the pictures.  Some touchpoints such as light switches were not clean. The kitchen countertop and table were not clean. Many surfaces were covered in thick dust, such as the top of the living room wall lights. The wood floor is very uneven and broken in places. It creaks very loudly with every step, making it impossible for others to sleep through. The road is noisy, even  in the evening and through the night not allowing you to open the windows to keep cool while you sleep. I am 6‚Äô-2‚Äù (190cm) tall which is too tall for the short bed in the master bedroom The hallway to the bathroom (tub/shower) is very narrow; I would guess around 23‚Äù (58cm) wide such that I had to turn sideways to pass through.  I would not stay here again."
"I can‚Äôt give this a 5 star review for a few reasons (even though I feel guilty because they specifically asked me to leave a 5 star review or don‚Äôt leave one at all.)  Positives: This is one of the only airbnbs we found in our budget that had 2 king size beds. And we could fit one person on the couch. Perfect kitchen space. Liked the 2 story layout to separate things. Lots of hot water. They did have a hair dryer even though they said they didn‚Äôt. Win! Location, location, location. The square was perfect so we could grab a quick bite to eat in the evenings. Close to metro stations for anyone who is okay with a quick 5-6 minute walk. Grocery store was really close too.  Negatives: The piece to hold the handheld shower was broken so you always had to hold the shower head unless you finagled it to stay and point at you right below chest height. (Should be able to secure it and have it above your head.) Which is why I didn‚Äôt wash my hair while I was here. The biggest problem was the smell that came from the bathroom and would sometimes start lingering downstairs. It smelled like it was either coming from the shower drain OR a moldy shower curtain. (Because the shower is at an angle the shower curtain was longer on one side, instead of just being cut with scissors, so it was always soaking wet and may have gotten a moldy smell.) But it was not a smell that we could handle so we shut the bathroom door. It made for a horrible sewer/moldy smell when you opened the bathroom door but it contained it. The only other negative is that there may be some sort of electrical thing going on with the lights in the living room area. I messaged the host and she mentioned it was on two switched but that wasn‚Äôt the problem. A couple times you had to turn the switch on/off like 20 times before the lights would actually stay on. They would turn on for a second then cut it. Or flicker like a strobe light then eventually stay on about 5 minutes into the process. One time we just gave up on it and left them off. That should probably be fixed too."
"Worst air bnb trip of my life! Host left the wrong keys at a restaurant that was closed anyways when I arrived at 4 pm. He then told me he was going to send the correct keys with a random stranger to a distant train station who would arrive 4 and 1/2 hours after I got to the flat. So I had no choice but to drag my bags way across town and wait at station until 8:30 pm when he was supposed to arrive.  Then I get a call (international charge) from a random man the host didn't even know but gave keys to, saying that he missed his train and now he wouldn't be in until 10:30pm, so I had to wait another 2 and 1/2 hours at the train station!  Was quite frightening being a young girl in foreign country waiting around for 8 hours at a train station waiting to meet a stranger with all my bags on me. Finally got the keys and into the flat after 2 crazy door key codes and some very finicky keys that barely worked at MIDNIGHT :(  Couldn't sleep after being so stressed out and wasting my entire first day. So ended up sleeping in the next day, as was so exhausted from the hassle. I really only got 1 and 1/2 days of my 3 day holiday to see Paris.  Also, there was only a 1/4 toilet roll with no spares and no kitchen paper towels or garage bags either. The bathroom was a bit dirty and there was lots of noise from restaurant below during the day.  The host was not very apologetic. He originally said he would give me a full nights refund for losing a full day of my trip but once I checked out and he got his money, he refused to do so. I've rented many air bnbs before with no issues but this time it ruined my entire trip was a terrible experience. I should have paid to take a 2 hour train ride back home to London which would have been much faster than getting his keys!"
"We stayed at Iris's place for a week and found that it met all of our needs for our stay. The place is conveniently located near metro stations (Grands Boulevards and Sentier) so that you can easily get to popular attractions either by walking or by metro. The place is equipped with a small kitchen (i.e. an electric stovetop, dishes, mini fridge, and an electric kettle but no pots or pans) and the sofa can convert into a second bed if needed. Iris responded quickly to all of our questions and we had no problems with our stay. Overall, we'd recommend Iris's place to anyone who is looking to stay in a convenient location on a budget."
"Company in charge of the flat gave us a wrong code to check in the appartment. We wasted time trying to find someone to help us and ended up calling them, wasting an international call unecessarily. Also an early check in was not granted. Difficult communication with the company. The kitchen has very limited items, not worth for the price charged.  Nevertheless the location was very good just a few minutes walking from Opera Metro station."
"The place in terms of location was pretty good, close to bus stops and metro station. However the positives stop there, the sofa bed was extremely uncomfortable as it doesn't lay flat and dips quite considerably in the middle. We had to detach the mattress and lay it on the floor instead to be able to sleep.  We stayed there when Paris was consistently 30+ degrees Celsius everyday (for 3 days) but the place didn't even have a fan. The streets nearby are extremely noisy at night and the early morning. We unfortunately know this because we had to leave our windows open at night due to again lack of fan.  They don't have dedicated wifi. Instead, they ask you to login to the city wifi and give you a bunch of logins to try. At one point we had about 7 logins which all didn't work. Incredibly frustrating and annoying.  When we checked in at 2:30pm, they room had not been cleaned and when we returned at night though it had been cleaned had no toilet paper. The shower basin is also quite dirty and mouldy. "
"Location is good, close to the station but the appartment is really small and no airconditioning so it was too humid to do anything inside  overal it was oke for a few days"
"The home is in the very centre of Paris; It is right next to Le Marais and very close to 2 metro stations that can take you anywhere.  All amenities listed in the description are available yet they are somewhat old, dirty/stained (hair dryer, kitchen utensils, even the door handle). The general cleanliness of the place is not good and it is the single reason why our rating is not 5 stars all around!"
"Nice and cozy apartment beside river Seine near the Eiffel tower. Metro station and supermarket is within five minutes walk, really convenient. Besides the nice accommodation experience you may want to make a photo record of everything in the room before leaving in case of any misunderstanding, very sad and disappointed not being trusted. Apart paying for a lamp that mysteriously broke in half after we left, the apartment was good."
"Parking lot was in the lower floor of the building.  The underground is directly in front of the building entrance (perfect to visit Paris).  The bed/couch was comfortable.  Security of the building was good. The area is not so nice at night, but from the underground station you have to go less than one minute, no problem for us."
"La habitaci√≥n est√° bien, es amplia y el ba√±o igual, es cerca a la estaci√≥n del metro, hay muchas cosas por mejorar, en la habitaci√≥n no servia la luz y ten√≠amos que usar una l√°mpara y por ende no ten√≠amos donde cargar los celulares, Elise es muy poco amable, no responde r√°pido y aunque en Airbnb el checkout es a las 11 am, fue muy grosera y tuvimos que salir a las 10 am, un hospedaje para no volver  The room and the bathroom is ok, it is close to the subway station, there are many things to improve, the light did not work in the room and we had to use a lamp and therefore we did not have where to charge our phones, Elise is very unfriendly, she doesn‚Äôt respond quickly and although in Airbnb the checkout is at 11 am, she was very rude and we had to leave at 10 am, a stay to never return"
"Wassim is a hard working host. He tried best for me. Ayman, who helps guests to check in, is a gentle man and working hard.  The location is also great. You can go to Effel tower by walk. And RER C station is very close to the apartment.  The apartment was not new. But it is not the point I want to talk about.  Smaller bedroom was little dank. I think it was because a bathroom is behind the wall. On the wall left side of the bed, there was a black sponge pad. I guess the pad was for covering wet damaged wall based on former comments about this apartment. Smell of the beds were not good also. I think they do not change duvet cover when new guests come. There were closets in the second bedroom, and it seemed newly painted. So I did not closed the door of the closets because I afraid of the smell of paint.  The plates and bowls in the kitchen was not clean. And the refrigerator were smelly.  In a nutshell, thought about the price, I do not recommend you to stay here if you are sensitive person about smell and cleanness."
The place was ok overall. Very convenient location and close to train station and restaurant&market etc What we did not like; I don‚Äôt know about the weekdays as we only stayed on Sunday but I would avoid weekend booking as we couldn‚Äôt sleep until 3 am due to restaurant crowds downstairs.
It was close to the city center and the main train station which provide you access to a lot of places. However this place is a bit noisy if you are staying on the side of the railway.
"The location of the apartment was great, close to a metro station and the city centre. However, we were quite disappointed by the apartment itself. The fifth floor is unpleasant but we new about it before our arrival so no problem, but the apartment is very very small. The host should give a warning that it‚Äôs not suitable for tall/big people. We are 180cm and 205 cm tall and we had problems to fit in the bathroom and the bedroom as well. There was also some missing kitchenware as there was only one teaspoon and no cutting board plus the knives were bent. The kitchenware was also dirty so we had to wash anything we wanted to use. There were a few other things as well including several broken/damaged things. All in all we would not book the apartment again as in our opinion it‚Äôs not worth the money."
Cozy but is 5 minutes to the nearest train station. Shower is a bit small but the bathroom is clean.  Is an old building so no lift in case a person might need assistance check first.
"We loved our stay here. It was spacious for our family of 3. The location is great - tucked in a quiet street but so close to the main street. It was close to bus stops and train stations as well. There were plenty of restaurants, shops, and little grocery stores around.  The only negative part was the neighbours. At least once a day, we could hear them screaming at each other. I don‚Äôt know if they are tenants or Airbnb guests. We just tuned them out with music."
"If we ever make it back to Paris I would gladly stay here again. The apartment is in a two minute walking distance to a metro station and there are many restaurants and shops in the area. Gaspard was very hospitable and even let us check in early due to our flight arrival. He also was extremely quick to respond when we had a couple questions. The neighborhood is very safe, almost every night we walked to dinner fairly late ( around ten) and came back close to midnight and never felt unsafe.   The apartment itself is pretty small, however if you are not planning on being there much of the day that shouldn't matter. The bathroom was my favorite part of the apartment because it was so big and has not just a beautiful shower but a bear claw tub which I was only able to use once to my regret. Gaspard also has a house keeper who will being fresh towels and sick while your gone. She even did the  dirty laundry we had. Overall I was very impressed. The only thing which could be confusing is that the main doors to get in, just get you into the courtyard. Then there's the doors to the building and once in the door to the apartment. Gaspard does explain that when he sends check in instructions though."
"Avoid this place at all cost until you can be assured construction inside the apartment hallways, entrance and elevator is complete and the apartment had been THOROUGHLY cleaned of construction dust. Although we were advised in the listing that there was construction in the building entrance, we were shocked and angered to discover that there was fine construction dust covering every surface inside the first (US 2nd) floor  apartment. This included on the furniture, floors, counters, linens and bath towels. Not long after arriving we could feel and taste the gritty dust in our mouths. Sitting on the chairs we picked up gray plaster-like dust on our dark clothing.  The host who let us into the apartment told us the place had been cleaned a day or two earlier but from a practical stand point that seems hard to believe. (Moreover, we found dirty, smelly dishes left in the dishwasher.) If it is true, there must have been an intense and rapid leak into this apartment for it to get so filthy so fast.  The location in St Germain is convenient to many shops in a nice Paris neighborhood and close to the St Placide Metro station. We enjoyed being in this part of town, but staying in the dirty conditions we encountered was intolerable."
Everything about the apartment was in line with what was provided in Airbnb. The location is really good which is 8 mins walking distance to Nation station. Only bad remark would be the wi-fi network which was not working at whole and i had no connection almost throughout my stay.
"Not much to say. I left after the first night and ended up booking a hotel in order to leave the Airbnb. Not worth it even for the price, more expensive after moving to a hotel! Dirty, smelly, very very uncomfortable, the mattress and pillows paper thin. Just a no for me. I was refunded ‚Ç¨30 for the cleaning, just wished I was returned more, at least a full night. Good location though, 10 min walk to the metro station."
"Although Alycia‚Äôs place was small, it was within walking distance to many of the sights in historic Paris and convenient to the train station.  The RER train from CDG was convenient - no more than a 15 minute walk from the station to the apartment.  There were plenty of coffee and small pastries for our four night stay."
"We stayed here for maximum convenience to be close to the train station, and it was perfect in that regard. The neighbourhood is ok, lots of great asian and indian restaurants around. The flat was new and clean and although basic, was well equipped. It was strange being located on the ground floor on the street front, it felt a bit like you were in a shop, but it was still private and quiet, and very convenient not having to bring luggage up stairs. The only downside was it did suffer from a bad smell coming back up the shower drains."
"Positive:  + close to metro stations + good location in term of closeness to main attractions (Louvre, Sacr√© Coeur, Latin district etc) located in north-eastern part + many restaurants not far away (500-900 m) + many doors that makes feel secured in that strange area (a bit complicated to go through many doors each time),  + kitchen with all dishes and appliances needed (except for the cooker hood) Negative: - strange people around, mainly street worker women - not for kid-friendly environment (sex-shops etc), a bit unsafe for me - missing amenities (no shampoos provided -door remote control did‚Äôt work, so had to enter 8 digit code every time entering  - needs renovation, some broken chairs to be changed - poor bedding and pillows, that you don‚Äôt want to lay on. Pillows have no shape being so old, - hot water not enough for taking shower by more than 1 person at a time -unclean toilet, shower, floor, dishes. Feels like someone just quickly wiped everything with a single, old, dirty rag"
"This place is very ""cozy"". Location is very close several Metro stations and shops. Mini-Chinatown is right in the area and the Opera-Comique is very close.  One thing if you have large luggage you will find it difficult store during stay, otherwise you will in a intimate space within walking distance a lot activities."
"The apartment is cosy but not meant for four people at all. We were there as couple and two kids and found it to be pretty small with no storage or cupboard available to use. There is literally no shelf available in the kitchen if we wanna cook something ourselves. Toilet has poor or no ventilation. Though the apartment is no smoking zone but as soon as you step out of the apartment, the corridor is full of smoky smell. The location is great and close to metro station approx 300 mtrs."
"The apartment was livable. The word cosy is to be taken literally. However, the apartment had a very distinct smell that did not disappear. There was a swarm of flies, we killed 5 ourselves and there were still more. There was only one mirror in the very small toilet/washroom so not good if a group of girls want to do their makeup. The bed is also very small.  The apartment was at a good location though, and just around 15-20 minutes walk from the Eiffel Tower like advertised. There was a bus station nearby and all major locations were easily accessible. The apartment was also quite warm and had a good heating system."
"The flat is centrally located with all amenities nearby. The local area is very charming and worth exploring. The patisserie just down the road may not be the finest in Paris but who am I to judge (loved their work). On leaving, we caught a taxi to Grad du Nord which cost us 8 Euros. A far cry from the 60 Euros that we were asked to pay by hustlers at the station on arrival."
Great place. Not center of Paris but close to an underground station so no problem. Dams was nice and helped us a lot with local tips.
"The apartment is on a quiet street no far from Moulin Rouge. It is convenient to get to a few metro stations. The apartment is big by Parisian standard, with a bedroom and one can convert the living room into another bedroom. It seems the owners live there some of the time, so it has all the features of a real home. We arrived late and had to pick up the keys from a lock box ina bar which is a good 8 minutes walk away. However, the codes given by the owner was incorrect and we had to text me to get the right codes. Check out was the same, we had to put back the keys in the lock box. Also? We only had one set of keys which is very inconvenient if you have more than 2 people."
Philippe is a terrific host. He had to wait hours for me to arrive because of two delayed flights and a traffic jam on the way from the airport. I didn't cook while I was there but the kitchen is well equipped. There's a small supermarket across the street and the Bastille market is just a couple of blocks away on Thursday and Sunday.  Metro stations and bus stops are close and it's about a 10 minute walk to the Marais. It's a good location. It rained most of the time I was there so I didn't really get to use the balcony which was a shame.
"No bed = No comfort First of all, I would like to appreciate Tommy's quick response and ability to give us the best advice on the stay in Paris. I liked the flat position, which is exactly right next to the metro station.  But on the other hand, I must inform other visitors about some issue I had with my accommodation in his apartment.  - There is no bed, only a few cabinets put together. Gaps between each cabinet are filled with books so they could substitute longer space. On them, few folded blankets which serve as a mattress. This is not only uncomfortable but it brings you a lot of painful night. This is the biggest problems I ever had with someone's bed during my travel all around the globe. I advise, buying new real mattress in the IKEA would be the best idea. If you scroll down on the review score of the apartment, this problem goes almost year back. Also, the level of tidiness didn't meet the required standards. The dirty toilet, floor, unfunctional sink in the bathroom, moldy refrigerator etc. + Location near the metro. Tomy reacts 24/7 on your messages."
"Pros * Very close to metro station, restaurants, and tourist attractions * Responsive and responsible host (they came to fix the slowly sink/shower drain a day after we reported it) Cons * Kitchen drawer doorknob broken, making it hard to open * No extra trash bags/toilet paper * Bad ventilation in the room (the fan provided doesn‚Äôt help much) * There‚Äôs no light in the kitchen (too dark to cook at night) * Sinking wood flooring near the entrance (when you walk pass, the floor visibly sinks) * Drains are slowing down again towards the end of our stay * The screws of the closet knobs are sticking out (almost hurt myself hanging my clothes) * There‚Äôs no vent in the bathroom (had to open the window to vent the steam when showering) * The shower head appears rusty/dirty and its slider is loosened (unable to change the shower head‚Äôs height) I acknowledge that some of the con‚Äôs might be cultural and are based on my past Airbnb experiences in the US."
"Overall, the apartment is very nice.  Like all places in Paris, it‚Äôs small, but it‚Äôs been recently renovated and the floor plan and furnishings make the most of the space.  There is only one toilet, but each bedroom has a shower and sink.  The windows are big, let in a lot of light, and face a park.  The nearest Metro station is on the same block as the apartment.  The neighborhood ‚Äì and even the block ‚Äì contain many choices for dining indoors or out, with options for lots of French and international cuisine.  There are 3 supermarkets within walking distance.  There‚Äôs an outdoor market open 2 days a week just a few blocks away.  There are 3 places to buy baked goods within 5 minutes by foot.   A series of minor annoyances is leading me to give Thomas‚Äôs place in the 15th arronndisement a less-than-stellar review.  In many ways the apartment was fine (or better), so I‚Äôll be as specific as possible with the issues we encountered.   Check-in did not go well.  After Thomas agreed to an early check-in for us, he dropped the conversation for nearly 24 hours.  We didn‚Äôt hear from him until 10 minutes prior to when I‚Äôd said we wanted to check in, and he seemed surprised that we were there ‚Äì even though I‚Äôd messaged him 3 times while we were on our way.  He sent over a messenger with the key which was nice, but he didn‚Äôt let us know which apartment we‚Äôd be staying in nor the code we needed to enter the building.  All-in-all, check-in took nearly an hour and I‚Äôd rate his communication as poor.  Here's the laundry list of the pretty minor issues we encountered:  he didn‚Äôt leave wi-fi instructions or information about where to leave the garbage and recycling.  The pillows on the bed are uncomfortable.  The freezer was left dirty.  There was no dish sponge or dish towel provided, so we needed to buy them because we were there for a month.  There was only one extra blanket.  The shower area tiles aren‚Äôt secured to the floor, so they wobble and are slippery when wet.  If it were only 1 or two of these things, I wouldn‚Äôt even mention it, but it was a lot all at once and none of it would be costly to improve. Last, Thomas didn‚Äôt leave any information about Paris or the neighborhood ‚Äì this isn‚Äôt so much a complaint as a ‚Äòwhy not‚Äô?  The neighborhood has quite a lot to offer and getting pointed in the right direction right from the get-go would have greatly enhanced our stay there.  My impression is that Thomas isn‚Äôt really into be a host so much as a landlord.  At a cost for the month of nearly $4K, that was disappointing."
"Place is good, to reach a metro stations and Eifle tower. Room is small, but everything inside the room, only one thing wasn't what we expected that toilet is next to the bed, but also there is public toilet in same floor. So that thing didint make our trip bad."
"We are four erasmus students and we booked this apartment on airbnb from September til half of January. When we arrived the place was dirty, there were a lot of bugs in the kitchen and the owner refused to pay for a disinfestation, so we had to do it ourselves. However Mehdi, the person who manages the apartment on the platform, was always kind and also proposed another apartment to us, but we had to refuse the offer because it was located in a neighbourhood that didn‚Äôt seem very safe. So we kept the apartment and, after a few adjustments (and a lot of cleaning), it wasn‚Äôt that bad. Overall, after the initial problems, we had a nice experience; however, I cannot leave more than a 3 stars review for the conditions the apartment was presented to us and for the complete negligence and lack of interest of the owner."
"The price was gods, the room was clean. The location is both good and bad, as it is close to many metro station and the Gare du Nord and Hare de l‚ÄôEst, but it also means that the area is quite noisy, but it is manageable."
"J√©r√¥me was a great host! Very friendly and helpful - I would definitely recommend staying here. The place was good - not super large, but it has enough space. The area was super convenient - right by metro stations, bus stop, grocery stores, restaurants, and boulangerie. There are a 3 flights of a spiral staircase - not enough to be a problem generally, but if stairs are an issue for you, be aware of this. And maybe try to pack lighter than I did üòÇ"
The loft is a good stay for a couple of nights only. It is a little out of the way for all the central attractions but pretty easy to get around with a train station close by. I was a little disappointed with the bathroom as it was quite dirty when we checked in and the toilet had a rotten smell coming from the plumbing. It was a decent place to stay for 2 nights but wouldn't recommend staying longer.
"If you are looking for a very medium place to sleep with some mild ""you *might* get murdered here but *probably not???"" vibes, this is the place for you. The rooms are small, the hallways are painted black (???), the floors are dirty,  and the pillows are like bags of rocks BUT the bed seemed clean, it was (for Paris) reasonably priced, and it is close to a Metro station. All in all, I would say it has all of the charm and amenities of a an upscale prison. You could do worse."
"We spent three nights at Maissoun 's apartment and the best part was the location. A two minute walk to the Voltaire subway station made visiting Paris easy and pleasant.  It was hot during our stay and due to the street noise, leaving the windows open at night was not really an option. A couple of little fans would be a great addition to the rental.  The amenities were quite sparse. We could not find a coffee maker.  The shower hose was broken but still usable until our second day. Maissoun's husband fixed it within hours, which was much appreciated.  Overall, the place has tasteful decor but if you look closely, the apartment comes off as cluttered and not so clean. For the price, I would say that dry towels upon arrival, kitchen linens, and a couple of fans would make the stay a bit better.  Oh, and be very careful with the luggage elevator. Do not stack bags inside of it, they may fall and block the internal door. If the internal door gets blocked, the elevator will get stuck and the only way to open it is to call the technician. There is a warning sign but it is not entirely clear. We made the mistake of using it (our fault in not reading the instructions closely enough) and ended up getting our suitcases stuck. We did have to call and pay for a technician to come out and fix it."
The flat is close to a couple of metro stations and only a 15 minute walk away from the Marais district and the Canal St Martin. There are plenty of restaurants and bars in the area and you are only a few minutes away from some supermarkets. There is currently building work taking place in one of the apartments in the same building and so there is some noise during working hours and the common areas of the block are covered in dust sheets.
"Anna and Laurant are great host and very responsive, the place was close to centre (3km) & station (200m), not clean neighbourhood, the place itself was almost look like pictures but the toilet door is broken and should be replaced, there is no kitchen table, and only one black sofa, the ceiling is short because the place was storage place, I think! In total it was just okay!"
The place is just as described. It‚Äôs close to two metro stations (one was closed while we were there) and Gare du Nord. The room is tight but you can expect that in Paris for the price. Only complaints would be the tiny bugs we found crawling on the walls and lack of ice in the hotel. I will also say this neighborhood isn‚Äôt ideal to walk alone in at night.
There are many cafe‚Äôs and restaurants around the neighborhood. Sacre cour is only a few steps away. And two metro stations just a few blocks away. The location is üôåüèª
"Melissa's appartment is just as in the pictures. It's located near two subway stations, which means you can be anywhere in the City in just half an hour.  The neighbourhood is quite lively at night, with several bars and restaurants nearby...  it might get a bit noisy, but after a long day in Paris we had no problem falling sleep anyway!  Melissa was a most welcoming host, she did her best to acommodate to our schedule and she even left us some stuff for breakfast.  The flat is actually her home, so obviously her personal belongings will be there (she did inform us of this fact beforehand). Nonetheless, it was all in order and clean. She did let us know when we arrived that the shower curtain had been ruined and she hadnt had the time to get a new one; it can be a bit impractical but not major issue.  We would definetely recommend Melissa's flat for a stay in Paris!  El departamento de Melissa es tal cual como se ve en las fotos. Se encuentra cerca de dos estaciones de metro y en media hora podes llegar a cualquier punto de la ciudad. De noche hay bastante movimiento, ya que hay bares y restaurantes cerca... Puede ser un poco ruidoso, pero personalmente, luego de un d√≠a largo en Par√≠s, no nos cost√≥ conciliar el sue√±o. Melissa hizo todo lo posible por adaptarse a nuestros horarios, tanto al llegar como al dejar el departamento, e incluso nos dej√≥ algunas cosas para desayunar. El departamento es su casa, por lo que obviamente sus pertenencias est√°n all√≠ (nos avis√≥ con anticipaci√≥n sobre esto). Sin embargo, el lugar estaba limpio y ordenado. Cuando llegamos nos avis√≥ que le hab√≠an arruinado la cortina de ba√±o y que no hab√≠a tenido tiempo para comprar una nueva; puede resultar inc√≥modo pero no fue un gran inconveniente en general.  Definitivamente recomendable para conocer Par√≠s!"
"Brilliant photos, BUT in fact studio is much smaller than looks on photos-like a dwarf house. If you open the sofa-bed can‚Äôt seat on a table.  Not clean at all - everything covered with dust, dishes are greasy, sheets not ironed, and have in mind that you will have just one towel for all ‚Äì face, body and feet. Sofa bed is very uncomfortable and squeaking. Metro station is really very close, but the region is predominantly black and not safe, we were robbed in the middle of the day. I wouldn‚Äôt recommend it and will be more picky next time."
"Studio with everything you need, reasonably priced and close to Gare de Lyon. We urgently needed a place to stay when our Eurostar was cancelled, and within 15 minutes of opening this website in the station, we were inside the studio. Really good instructions to enter. One imporant issue, though, is that the sofabed (the only bed) is very uncomfortable and we slept badly both nights. If the owner changed the sofabed we would give this place 5 stars."
"Nothing but great things to say about my 4 night stay. Staff, room, bed, shower, breakfast, coffee, food, work stations and vibe all great.  Great location. Luxembourg Metro stop 5 minutes walk. 10.35 euro 35 minutes train ride from Paris CDG. If you like walk, the only way to see Paris, everything is within a ~ 30 minutes walk.  Highly recommend!!"
Pros: 1. The place is very close to the station and is quite convenient 2. The place does not feel cramped 3. A decent number of amenities for the price in a relatively clean apt Cons: 1. The building lobbies have no lights. It feels almost abandoned when you try to go inside after sunset (even though it doesn't in the day) 2. The key collection/deposit procedure is kinda hacky and can be a bit hard to do especially since the room has no lights and involves a locked postbox. 3. The bed is folded. It doesn't feel comfortable at all. It tries to fold up while you sleep on it. The bedding didn't seem like it had been washed. Not completely dirty but also not washed after the last user. There should at least be an instruction sheet as to how to unfold it properly if it is possible to do that.
"3 people stayed 4 nights in my family.  There was a little difficulty in explaining the check-in, I was able to enter with the help of other residents and two towels were not enough to stay for four days. I don't know if it's a translation problem, but the answer was a little unkind. The lock on the front door was really problematic. Every night after returning from the city tour, I had to try for more than 10minutes to open the door. The host  said there was no problem, but the key didn't work exactly. The location of the house was good because it was close to the subway station."
"The apartment is close to metro station, so there is no problem reaching all parts of Paris. There are also many restaurants or bars in the area of apartment or food shops if you want to spent a night in. "
Very well located and cozy apartment - across the street from the metro station with lots of restaurants nearby. The only issue is that the apartment‚Äôs noise isolation (from the corredor and apartment next door) that were not great.
If you need a 1 night sleep close to the train station then this is fine. It is old and tired with too much clutter in a dark corner of the building. Window opens to a rooftop and a brick wall. The bed was not what was in the picture but just a mattress and box spring almost on the floor. No top sheet on the bed. Just a quilt. Only 2 towels in the bathroom to shower with and no hand towel or face cloth. Had to wait a while to have a second person shower.  Not enough hot water! The pictures are not accurate so be aware.  Not a 'Lovely Nest' I'm afraid. Not a good value. We left very early in the morning
"Since it was a school holiday week, Vittoria and her family were away when we arrived.  The housekeeper met us at the boat, gave us the key, helped get our luggage down the ladder (quite steep), then departed.    We met Vittoria and Herve a few days later.  Both were very friendly; Vittoria gave us some home-made jam, also some bread and apples from Normandy.  When we left, Herve volunteered to bring our luggage up the ladder, which we greatly appreciated.  The location was superb--right on the Seine, almost under the Eiffel Tower, about a block from RER and  Metro stations. There was almost no traffic noise from nearby streets.  For us, the boat had two big problems.  To access the studio, it was necessary to climb down a steep ladder into the boat.  Further, the bath tub/shower was small and was elevated about four feet off the floor.  To get into it, we had to climb two vertical wooden steps attached to the side of the tub.  There is not enough room to stand up in the tub/shower enclosure, even for my wife, who is about 5' tall.  To take a ""shower,"" I (6' tall) had to crouch on my hands and knees--very uncomfortable and annoying.  Our major complaint was that neither the ladder nor the tub/shower situation were disclosed in the listing description or in the photos.  We told Vittoria, she acknowledged that we were correct, and said even though other guests hadn't had problems, she would amend the listing.  I found it somewhat difficult to get into the bed since it is right against the wall and there is a table almost against the bottom of the bed.  "
"Chefia‚Äôs place is very convenient. It is close to the Metro stations and many restaurants. Her place was a little small for 4 adults, but if you are like us, who do not  spend a lot of time in the apartment, then, it shouldn‚Äôt be a problem. The apartment has A large bedroom with a double bed and two twin bed; a combined living room and a breakfast table; a shower and WC; small kitchen with microwave and cooking stove, washing machine and  supplies of cleaning products."
"When we arrived at the airbnb, we were hit with a strong sewage odor that was hard to ignore.  We traced it to the kitchen sink and tried to plug it to control the odor without much success. Also, the downstairs bedroom had this wet towel/musky smell that we soon realized was from the wet rug.  The stench in the bedroom made it difficult to sleep in and thus unusable. We contacted the host about it and while they were very prompt with their response, they ultimately were not able to eliminate the odor.  If not for this issue, we would have enjoyed our stay, especially since it is conveniently located by a metro station."
"Good option for budget priority tourist. Excellent location with cafes, restaurants, markets, Metro stations, stores nearby. We found bathroom door was broken at the first day when check-in and bloom and bucket was also unable to use. No one come to fix it until the last day we check-out. (We stayed 18 night.)"
"1. The accommodation is located near the North Station. It's very scary at night. It's not a place to go alone or among women.  2. Geographically, there was no inconvenience because the subway station was 10 minutes' walk away. The market is right in front of you, and everything is workable at home. 3. What's missing is that I can hear all the other rooms talking."
"The apartment was convenient, right around the corner from a metro station, restaurants, and a grocery store. It was big enough for my family of four to spread out. It was well appointed with toilet paper, dishes, cleaning supplies, and towels. The door was tricky to lock, but we figured it out eventually. There was no clothes dryer, but we were able to hang our clothes after washing. Maximilienne responded to all messages and gave advice for traveling from the airport."
"The stay had both good and bad parts. The good part was that the building is very close to cafes, metro and bus stations, you can easily move around the city from there and the host is very ok, communicative, he even helped us with the luggages. It was our first time in Paris so it was very shocking that the apartments are so small, the building itself was small also, we barely had space to carry our luggages, but it isn‚Äôt anybody‚Äôs fault. For our taste it was kind of dirty. The shower head was very used, rusty and full of soap remains. The carpet had large dirt marks and the apartment smelled like mold all the time so we had to let the window open the whole time even though it was chilly outside. The building smelled horrible all the time as the trash is kept inside the building. All in all, for this price and location of the building it‚Äôs ok."
"The location is great and central, while a minute or two from a Metro station. The apartment appears as on the photos but some furniture is a bit run down and a little maintenance is needed. Also communication with host is rather disappointing - no reply on messages at all."
"Extremely uncomfortable with our stay here, the area is not a safe area for a comfortable stay. The street is dirty and overcrowded by the metro station and the trash wasn‚Äôt taken out on the street. There is noise pollution that can be heard from nearby metro bars and restaurants that kept my partner and I awake. There is no private sleeping accommodations, but a small pull-out couch without blinds to block out bright street lights. It is right next to the busiest Gare du Nord train station, this can be heard at all times and there was no working Wifi during our entire stay. There was a break-in during our time in the building, with damage to the front entry-way and the streets are unsafe for walking at night. The inside interior is very stylish and clean, but it isn‚Äôt what is advertised as a safe or quiet street. Stay in a safer area and avoid the cost of paying for this rental. We had a very terrible Airbnb experience with the owner and advise to stay in a better neighborhood and apartment building in Paris."
"I have mixed feelings about this apartment. Some repairers need to be done (toilet seat, shower door) . I accidentally opened an old kitchen fridge (there are 2 fridges in the kitchen, newer fridge was ok) and smell was horrible, so I had to keep windows open half a day to get rid of this smell.  The good thing about apartment is the location, very convenient, close to metro station, grocery stores, bakeries, restaurants. Easy check in and communication with the owner. For this price this is a good find, but be aware of these problems."
"Good location, lots of places to walk to: train station nearby, Louvre 20 minutes.  Great for young people, not so great for overweight guests who would have a very hard time getting into the bathroom or the two people that can fit in the elevator without luggage."
"Place could use a little polish. The location is great - beautiful street very accessible. Grocery store up a block, multiple metro stations near.  Plentiful beds, lots of sheets - could use some more washcloths and hand towels as well as bath towels in general for the amount of beds. Stairs are treacherous - not for old or kids. Toilets are not in a traditional bathroom but closets halfway up stairs - literally right off the stairs.  Kitchen has a random array of pots with no matching lids and containers with no matching lids. Dishwasher did not work,  dryer did not work, but drying racks were plentiful.  Sofa settee was covered with a sheet/broken down underneath it- wood frame made it uncomfortable.  Not enough enough seating in the main room - one sofa and the small settee and chair (may be antiques under the sheets covering them) but as tall people they were a bit awkward and low to the ground. TVs in main, kitchen and one bedroom with Netflix subscription - nice."
Nice apartment really close to a metro station and grocery stores. Kitchen and bathroom is well equip and had working heating/air con. The apartment is on a main road but quiet with the windows closed. Living room is not very spacious but enough if you‚Äôre out most of the day exploring the city. The WiFi connection was not great as most of our devices could not connect.
"The apartment is well furnished and nice even though i would recommend it for 6 people, not 8 since one of the sofa beds is not comfortable at all. Great position, it is a 3 minute walk to the metro station and a 20 minute walk to the Louvre or Montmartre on a budget! The host was really available throughout the stay, we asked for more towels since we had 6 and we were 8 and they brought us also some missing cushions. Unfortunately on the last day we noticed a child‚Äôs bed was missing from the apartment and we were told someone got in to take it but without our permission, that was kind of disappointing but the host told us it was a mistake. Overall i think this might be a good option for staying in paris."
"Generally quite decent apartment and close to metro stations. Unfortunately however, we had to deal with what we felt was a totally unreasonable request on the part of the owner that soured the overall experience."
It is only one block to a metro and walking distance to both main train stations. Very small and up 5 floors of stairs. Low ceiling feels tight for a tall person.
"This flat was the perfect stay for us in Paris. Very close walk to a few metro stations. It was very spacious/ open and provided everything we needed. It can get a little loud at night when the windows are open but didn‚Äôt bother us much. This flat requires you to walk up 5 flights of steep stairs (no lifts) so if you can‚Äôt do that, it‚Äôs not the place for you."
"Unfortunately, the house was not as clean as expected.  After pulling out the bed in the living room the sheets and blankets were dirty.  The towels smelled as if the stayed in the washer too long.  Fortunately, the apartment has washer and I was able to wash them.  Eric was easy to communicate and very accommodating he did send a set of clean blankets right away.  Location was good but there were times we didn't feel safe,  there were people hanging around the building late at night and we encountered several men fighting.  There was a protest outside the apartment during our stay and we were forced to leave the apartment during the day,  it was impossible to watch tv or relax.  Restaurants and local business were equally upset with the situation. On the other hand the apartment is conveniently located next to the train station so getting to Disneyland was a breeze.   Overall we had a pleasant stay but the protester made it difficult to enjoy it at its fullest."
"Really nice central location, especially for underground and one of the main train stations in Paris.  Only downside is that the room was not very clean."
"The place is a small and quiet apartment in a typical Parisian building (early 20th century?), less than 5 min walk from the metro station with plenty of grocery shops and restaurants/cafes in the area. Emmanuelle lives in this apartment, which allows for an authentic experience. She left coffee and milk for us for breakfast and was very accommodating with the check-in and -out hours. The place is exactly as presented in the pictures, but I wouldn't recommend it for 4 adults since the sofa bed in the living room, if extended, blocks the access to the bathroom from the bedroom. We had a 10 y.o. who slept on the width of the half-unfolded bed and that was ok."
"Dirty cutlery, dusty bowls, no plates. Bathroom was heavily covered in mould. Food splatter up the side of the wall beside the cooker. Plugs in the kitchen did not work so had to move the microwave to the living room area. A very sketchy neighbourhood, we had a few run ins that could of ended differently. The only positive is that it is very close to the main train station. However I would not recommend for young girl travellers."
"Pros: - The neighborhood was really nice. It felt very local and had many nice places nearby. Also, 3 metro stations, an amazing artisanal cheese place in front, and supermarkets. - The view from the appartment windows was amazing and had great natural light. - Had a good heating system and hot water. Cons:  - Check-in process: we arrived at 11pm as we had previously told Betty, but when we got there, it was really had for us to communicate with her. We waited in the hall of the building for 30 minutes. We texted Betty several times and called her 3 times and she didn't answer. We had to walk to a nearby hotel to get wifi to be able to get a hold of her but we got no answer. We had to call her on the intercom (which she had asked us not to use since her daughters were asleep) but we were a bit desperate to get in.  - Slow communication: the day before arriving I was a bit worried since I hadn't received a responde from Betty telling that she was going to be there at the time we arrived.  - Dated decoration - Clogged kitchen sink with bad smell"
"Firstly, the location was great. Perfect area in Paris, with restaurants, bars, shops and the metro station just outside the door. However, there was a nightclub very close by and it was so noisy with music until the early hours and then what sounded like deliveries from very early in the moring.  Unfortunately the apartment felt quite dated and generally dirty. There was dust throughout. The lighting in the main living room and also the toilet was poor. There was no hot water in the kitchen and the pressure was terrible, even when we tried running the tap for a long time. The host was very responsive to communication and fixed the shower which was blocked."
"Even though the north of Paris is known to not be a very nice area, it is very closely located to the north train station and buses. The first day that we were there wasn't good because the WiFi didnt work and the guy who rented us the room didnt tell his roommates about us so they had started painting the living room. Because of that they were not very happy we were there.  Additionally the elevator stopped working the day we got there. It may have just been bad timing. We were also told that we were not allowed to use the nice bathroom and that we had to use the shower, which did not look clean at all. After all of that, the host was very nice to let us leave our bags there until we had to leave, which was late at night. It was a very nice place other than those factors and the room was clean. I hope the stay for the next person is better than ours."
"Our sincerest apologies for a negative review, however with the number of issues we had and lack of response to our concerns we felt our honesty was best for future guests to be aware, as it is something we would‚Äôve appreciated knowing prior to booking.  We don‚Äôt ever like to leave bad reviews, and this is the first time we have had an experience like this, but we feel we should be honest in our review so future guests are aware of some possible misleading inaccuracies in this listing.  Some of these things might be addressed before future stays, but it is worth being aware of certain things particularly the noise all night long.  Communication with the host David was delayed and at times non-responsive.  We felt the cost/value of the stay did not reflect the current state of the apartment, the amenities and location (noise ground floor apartment with bedroom windows on street and right next to entry and exit doors which buzz and slam all night long as people come and go).  We messaged the host David twice to discuss our concerns and ask about the possibility of a partial refund for the issues, as the apartment was already over our budget and we thought we were happy to pay a little extra for a quality space, but this was not the case and we received no response from David.  It should be noted that the apartment is on the ground floor right next to the entry and exit doors for the building. People coming and going all night long meant we were continually woken by the buzzer and the front door slamming and then the gate buzzer and gate slamming. The bedrooms are also on the street level with only frosted glass separating you and the street. With bars and clubs around there were people passing by talking most of the night.  The apartment was incredibly hot and stuffy (particularly as we visited during a heat wave). Even with the small windows open in the bedroom. The windows in the bedrooms open directly onto the street and is even more noisy when open which made it very hard to sleep. And it‚Äôs worth noting there is no air conditioning so without air conditioning or windows open it can get hot a stuffy inside.  The courtyard pictured in the listing is not a private courtyard. It is the public courtyard for the entire building so you cannot leave the back doors open at night for ventilation. The apartment facilities themselves were very rundown with many things broken.  The window was broken in the master bedroom and stayed open. When we messaged the host David but he did not reply. I messaged him again the second night he said The cleaner advised you need to jam a knife into the window to hold it shut and sent a picture of the knife wedged in to show us how.  The shower in the main bathroom is broken and quite deteriorated with the powder coating crumbling off and the handle for the top shower broken and missing. Only the handheld works and it is stuck in at an odd angle that you can‚Äôt change which made showering the kids tricky. We didn‚Äôt use the shower on the ground floor because the room smelt so strongly of mould/mildew, ceiling and walls were crumbling and there was mould on the shower floor. The sofa was badly damaged with one arm sagging and falling off completely and a large burn hole in the other arm. The sofa was also very dirty and badly in need of cleaning. It had blankets laid over it to cover the dirty marks.  The basement was The coolest place in the building however it smelt strongly of mould/mildew with damp rising in the walls. The render and paint was crumbling off the walls. Our daughter with asthma began coughing quite badly after 5 minutes downstairs so we avoided using the space. Overall we were disappointed, but to finish on some positive notes the beds were comfortable and linen was fresh and clean. The proximity to restaurants, metro stations, cafes and Le Marais is good. David allowed us early check-in to leave our bags in the space while the cleaners were there which was nice.  Again, our sincerest apologies for a negative review however with the number of issues we had and lack of response to our concerns we felt our honesty was best for future guests to be aware, as it is something we would‚Äôve appreciated knowing prior to booking."
"The place is located in a not nice neighborhood, however it has a near metro station which helps to move around paris. The cleaning was not well, you can feel the sticky floor and the bed was very uncomfortable. They should change the mattress!  it not help to rest through a long trip. The access was not easy, the lock has a trick to open, also it not has AC, which is a huge problem in the summer."
"Nice place, near Gare du Nord station, easy to go anywhere by metro/train. At night I avoided walking in the neighborhood, because it felt somehow unsafe, but saw no problem during the days we were there."
"This is my review of the Accommodation: Positive points: The place is good for many people, it is close to several metro stops, it has two supermarkets nearby, it is close to the train station in case of going somewhere nearby. Points to improve: The place when we arrived was incredibly dirty, under the beds there was a lot of dust and lint, we had to sweep and mop so that the children were there, the water came out black! Some sheets had red spots that looked like blood (i.e. washed but that the stain had not been removed) really disgusting, the mattresses had a lot of stains, the towels stunk, one of the mattresses had a hole. The washer and dryer room was really dirty, the dryer (neither) dried well. The hair dryer didn't work either Very poor quality, there were lights that did not work, in the bathroom there was no light There are no good curtains, the neighbors could see us without problem, there are windows in the bathrooms which do not have curtains. It is important to notify those who want to stay here that you can not open the windows if you want to talk, that is, there are warnings that if you want to open the windows you must be completely silent since it is heard in the other departments, we were 15 people, obviously we were going to speak. It should be noted that we were at almost 40c and we could not open the windows, that place looked like an oven. (It has no AC) The neighbor above has a piano, which during our stay made a party we could not sleep. Finally, the owner ""told us"" that a person would go to the departments to get ""something"", I found it extremely inappropriate to rent a place and not even ask if they can go, just go and enter, where there is something called PRIVACY. In general we were a large group and despite the discomforts we were together, I would not rent it again."
"It was the last leg of our European trip and we were headed for three days in Paris. Our instructions came shortly before our stay; check-in times seemed to change every time I got another e-mail. We had to wait nearly an hour in a laundromat to get our keys. We took a second taxi to the apartment building. Charlotte said that her apartment was on the 2nd floor. We‚Äôve traveled often enough in Europe to know that means that the apartment would be on the American third floor but the key would not open the door. She was not being helpful in her messages and my phone was running out of power. We finally tried one more idea: go down one level below and try the key. It worked.  The apartment was spacious and nicely decorated but we were shocked to see many sticky notes on cabinets and doors saying ‚Äúdon‚Äôt open‚Äù and ‚Äúdon‚Äôt touch‚Äù. One of them was on the large refrigerator. When we opened the doors, both the freezer and refrigerator were full of taped up bins of food. My husband loves to cook but there was no room in the refrigerator for us to add our own so the supermarket was out of the question. On our third day our hostess dropped a bomb on us. We‚Äôd told her way ahead of time that we were leaving very early on the next morning, 4:30am, to head to the airport. She said that we‚Äôd have to travel to a train station in another part of the city to return the keys. We wrote that it was impossible to do so, but she insisted. We‚Äôve never been in a position like this before and we‚Äôve stayed at many airbnbs over the decades. Normally we just leave the keys on the table and lock the door behind us. There was no way that we could run this errand, especially since we‚Äôd be carrying our six bags. This demand could make us miss our flight so we told her in an e-mail that we were going to leave that evening at 6:30pm and if someone didn‚Äôt come for the keys, we‚Äôd leave them on the table. We booked a hotel close to the airport and hailed a taxi. We asked for a refund for the last day because we had to stay and pay for a hotel elsewhere but we haven‚Äôt heard anything from her."
"While the apartment was ok, the smell of urine coming from the street during our stay was intolerable. No aircon, so we had to keep the windows open during the heat, but that meant the whole place smelled like a bad toilet. Noisy street! On the plus side, there were many cool bars within walking distance (7-10 mins). Montmarte was a 20-minute walk from the apartment. The nearest station to the apartment is Marcadet-Poissonniers."
"Listing photos and description does not match at all.  The floors made more creeky sounds than the train station.  They were late to let us into our rental and when we entered it was not cleaned from the previous renters.  The cleaner arrived 2 hours later and by that time we had already decided that it was uninhabitable for our family with two young children.  The place smelled, the furniture was dusty and dirty, linen and dirty towels all over the floor.  I wouldn't recommend this place."
Location was great right next to the train station. It was definitely well priced for peak tourist season.  Cleaning was not up to the mark!  The mat in the bathroom had mold; balcony was dirty; dirty bathroom counter . Description of property was inaccurate/misleading - in the US 1.5 bath means 1 toilet + bathroom ; and 1 more toilet . It was just 1 bathroom and 1 toilet . Some of their personal belongings could hv been removed - like crib in the bedroom which left us with very little place to walk. The towels were rough & of poor quality and request for additional towels was denied.
"Buyer beware!  We did not have a good stay and would not recommend this place. We left early. We had multiple, multiple issues at this stay.  I've never had to leave a review like this before. Keep in mind the title says, LUXURY.  Not sure what the previous reviews were talking about. Issues: 1) There is only 1 set of keys.  Yes you heard correctly...for a place that sleeps 6 people...there is only 1 set of keys.  We explained that it would be really impossible to coordinate with multiple adults all having different tours and schedules, but the host says nobody ever asked for this in the past. She said our request was a dead end.  Side note: you have to pick up and drop off the key at a hotel that is a good 15 minute walk from the apartment, so do keep that in mind depending on your luggage situation.  Every place we've ever stayed had 2 sets of keys or digital lock with code.  We found her ""dead end"" response unhelpful. 2) Cleanliness was terrible.  Pictures were shared with the host and the cleaning fee was refunded after she agreed it was not properly cleaned. The showers had tons of mold and mildew. Cobwebs all over from built up dust and other people's hairs on the comforter for the sofa (that was really gross).  Dirty dishware, and a dirty screwdriver in with the silverware.  3) Host was defensive from the start.  When we asked about an extra set of keys she tried to imply that we were overly needy. Although Vanessa was responsive she just refused to take responsibility for any of our concerns by using phrases like:  ""I'm not the owner...and I'm not the housekeeper...mistakes happen."" 4) Privacy issue!  While my wife was getting out of the shower and I was shaving in my underwear, the housekeeper came into the apartment unexpectedly WITHOUT knocking.  She had our Airbnb mixed up with the one next door.  I guess through that experience we learned that actually a 2nd set of keys does exist but the host didn't want to provide it.  We were willing to pay any fee, because it would have saved us cancelling tours/tickets.  5) Not a good place for light sleepers.  You can hear the metro line rumbling by every 1-5 mins.  It sounds like a light earthquake every time.  Really good location...between Mongallet and Reuilly - Diderot metro stations, near to grocery stores, cafes, etc.  We ended up leaving early and after the housekeeper issue and then sharing the pics about the lack of cleanliness.  The most helpful thing during our entire stay is that the host agreed to refund our money for the 3 remaining nights we were out, and the cleaning fee. I would recommend the host visit the apartment in person to verify all amenities (such as soap and shampoo) are provided as promised.  This also allows the host to verify the cleanliness.  It should not be a surprise that a guest would request an extra pillow or towel during their stay...maybe the host should just go ahead an get more than 1 of each for the LUXURY of it.  Be prepared to supply ALL pantry items such as salt, pepper, tea, sugar, paper towels, hand soap, etc."
"It's more like having a roommate rather than staying at bnb as host works from home and we see each other very often.  It is a small flat, two bedrooms separated by thin walls, the sound proof is not excellent so I always worry if I will disturb the host. Lydie has a lot of principles/ house rules so sometimes there might be problems due to our different living habits for example I  take shower at night after work but it is forbidden to shower after 23h inside the flat.  Lydie is a responsible host, always tries to be helpful and always try to chat with me when we meet in flat. Â∞çÈÉ®ÂàÜ‰∫∫‰æÜË™™ÈÄôÂÄãÊàøÊù±ÊáâË©≤ËÆì‰∫∫È¥®Âäõ‰∏çÂ∞èÔºöÔºâ The area is quite and with a lot of restaurants and supermarkets around,  metro station is 7 min walk away. bus stop just in front of the building but buses always delay so I ended up taking metro most of the times.  Thanks for sharing the flat with me."
"Place is clean and very convenient. Train station,  grocery stores and restaurants are within a block or two"
"Location great and central (5 minute to Miromesnil metro station), while apartment still very peaceful. Wifi worked well. For 6 weeks I was only given one towel and one set of bed sheets, but I got more after requesting them. Quality of some facilities was poor: mainly the round table was wobbly and unusable and light switches were unstable weak plastic. Just little things like that around the apartment. Overall stay was okay but for a longer time I would reconsider."
Overall it was good stay as location was very convenient just in front of the station.  Although I could see some equipments were quite worn out and there‚Äôs no air coming in and out. Summer time should be tough without fan!  Flora was very approachable and always has quick response!
Florence is a very communicative host and very friendly and approachable. The place was a little small for our stay but it was very warm. The elevator is too small for the bags‚Ä¶. The bed is not as comfortable for two people. It doesn‚Äôt have Laundrymat but there is one a block away. There are cafes and restaurants nearby and we could use the kitchen as well. Montmarte is relatively close. It has convenient metro stations a few blocks away.
"A light and spacious, rustic, genuine, yet fairly stylish apartment as shown in the photos, in a quiet neighbourhood. Well equipped and nice to have a cinema room.  Unfortunately in our case the flat was not very clean and had musty, unclean and some unpleasant smells. The bathroom had a dirty drain smell, the small bedroom had what seemed to us like a damp smell.  Combined with the very run down entrance to and stairway in the building, the arrival experience was not very good. Our socks were instantly very dirty and there were even dishes still in the dishwasher (luckily clean).  Check in was OK,  but due to our train to Paris arriving close to 10pm and being delayed, we arrived around 10:30pm (15-20 mins after the time we originally informed). Given that the train station was still full of travellers arriving and the city full of people eating and drinking, it seemed unreasonable to be charged a late check in fee for check in after 10pm."
"Positives: The apt was spacious & bright and had a nice deck.  Negatives:  Housekeeping is an issue.  The bathroom on the main floor is in desperate need of a thorough and deep cleaning.  Mold and grime has taken over the shower, so much so that of course you can not only see it, but you can smell it.  The bathroom floor was shockingly dirty.  The bath towels were old and dreadful and there were too many chipped coffee mugs in the cabinet.  The apartment is located in a questionable area, making one feel less than secure.  There is little peace and quiet on the streets at night.  From inside the apartment you will hear plenty of screaming and yelling into the wee hours of the morning.  As my sister & her husband sat at the cafe next door to the apt on our first day there, they along with other patrons were mooned by a woman who was shooed away by the owner of the cafe for begging.  You will be wise to guard your belongings carefully when out on the streets in parts of the area and in two of the closest Metro stations.  Keep your eyes on the eyes watching you.    Lastly,  the beds are not comfortable.  Bottom line, few people would accept a hotel room in the condition of this apartment.  In our opinion, this apartment was not a good value for the money."
"We stayed at this apartment during the entire week of the heatwave in June of 2017.  Instead of the June highs ranging from 65 to 80, it was almost 99 on the hottest day.  Much of my experience is colored by this.  There are a lot of big windows that you can open, but if you have to leave them open overnight, there is a lot of noise outside that can disturb sleep.  I don't think it's as noticeable when the windows are closed.  Beeping trucks and pressure washers start really early in the morning -- this is noticeable with the windows closed. The place was large enough for our family of five adult-sized people to sleep and lounge.  We thought that having only one toilet would be a problem, but it's separated from the two shower rooms so we didn't have any issues.  The washrooms are superb.  The showers had good pressure, felt good and we didn't run out of hot water. There's many convenient things around:  There are many close places to grab something to eat and a little grocery store down the block.  Across the street there's a cash machine and a creperie that's open really late.  Quatre Septembre underground station is next door and Opera is about a block and a half away. I would definitely stay here again -- if it's under 75 degrees though."
"Airbnb review Pros - incredible location, a 2 minute walk from the train station attached to a mall. Walking distance to many museums such as the louvre and centre pompidou. Plenty of great restaurants on the block.  - The airbnb itself is beautiful and great size for two people. Value is great for how much you are paying Cons - check in process required you to meet with someone from the host company that will check you in. This caused a lot of back and forth between the airbnb ‚Äúhost‚Äù and the person meeting you to check in. There also was a lack of communication between these two parties, so they were sending us back and forth for answers. We were worried that we might be cancelled on but everything was totally fine in the end. We also were hoping to check in at 2pm listed in the posting, but their team couldn‚Äôt actually meet us until 3pm.  - I‚Äôm not sure if someone lives here regularly, but half the closet space was taken up by someone else‚Äôs clothes. - The hair dryer was broken, and although they offered to send us one, there was a lot of chasing around to coordinate the drop off, so we decided to just live without it. - they didn‚Äôt provide any details on where to throw out trash or boxes we needed to get rid of from our shopping Would I recommend this airbnb to anyone in the future? Yes and no. If you are willing to take the risk of them potentially cancelling and a stressful check in experience the airbnb‚Äôs location and design make up for it. Would I personally risk it again? No."
"Sarah is very helpful and promptly responds every message. The apartment is very well located within a 2 minute walk from Nation (both metro and train station). Even though the apartment was nice, it did lack a bit of cleaning. There were some foods open in the refrigerator which made the stay a bit uncomfortable because we had no clue for how long they had been there and we could not put any of our groceries in. Some other bathroom products were missing and some were very old and disgusting. There was also some dead flowers in a vase right next to the bed. Additionally, the apartment was not 100% like the photos on the website, some different furniture like a bean bag."
"Die Lage des Hotels ist top. Man befindet sich direkt im Quartier Latin mit vielen kleinen Cafes und Restaurants. Notre Dame sowie die Metro-Station sind direkt um die Ecke. Das Personal war sehr freundlich, die Zimmer sauber und der Check-in sowie Check-out klappte problemlos. Wir werden das Hotel definitiv wieder besuchen! Preis-Leistungs-Verh√§ltnis...1 mit Sternchen  :) The location of the hotel is great. You are in the middle of the Latin Quarter with many small cafes and restaurants. Notre Dame and the metro station are just around the corner. The staff was very friendly, the rooms were clean and the check-in and check-out went smoothly. We will definitely visit the hotel again! Value for money ... A with a star :)   La ubicaci√≥n del hotel es genial. Esta justo en el Barrio ""Quartier Latin"" con muchos peque√±os caf√©s y restaurantes. Notre Dame y la estaci√≥n de metro est√°n a la vuelta de la esquina. El personal era muy amable, las habitaciones estaban limpias y el registro y la salida se realizaron sin problemas. ¬°Definitivamente volveremos a visitar el hotel! Relacion precio-calidad ... A con una estrella :)"
"Apartment seemed a bit neglected, regarding both cleaning and decoration. On top of that, the bed is placed near a thin wall with barely no sound insulation. Behind that is the building's main wooden staircase making it hard to sleep at night if there is any movement. However, place is conveniently located near 2 central metro stations so if you don't mind the rest would recommend. We did not get to meet the landlords so no opinion on that, their answers were to the point and fast."
"If you‚Äôre just looking for shelter (I.e. roof, bed, and a bathroom) and are on a budget, this place is fine. Otherwise, would not recommend to first time solo-female travelers. Area is not great. Partner was harassed by a drunkard within 30 minutes of arriving around 9pm. Roach ran across the hall upon entrance. Loud noise from train station. Shower has cheesy LED light-up shower head. Some litter in the room upon arrival. I don‚Äôt know how the other reviews were so positive, but my partner and I were both very disappointed and promptly found another place to stay. If you‚Äôre looking to have a romantic vacation in Paris, I would look elsewhere."
"The house was in good condition, clean and as seen in pictures, the household was nice and close to the metro station. The bed in the bedroom was a little uncomfortable but ok, One negative side, amenities for 4 people 3 nights were only 1 little shampoo, 1 little gel and 1 little soap, communication with Cedric on increasing the amount does not work, he refuses to supply more"
"The place is much older than the photos. The sofa is old, few chairs are not in good conditions.  The worst is bugs  on the single beds.  So we gave up that room.  My children slept in the sofa. No rubbish bag in rubbish bin.  Kittle and coffee machine share one power socket, just not convenience.  I don't think they expect cooking in the kitchen because it is not well prepared. Location is convenience, easy to reach shopping, restaurants and stations but noise. Not really suitable for family."
"Apartment is really close to Montmartre and Sacre Coeur, close to many restaurants, bars and supermarkets. There is a very close metro station, even if I have to say it doesn't look really nice to walk close to it at night.  Apartment itself was very nice and Luckey was always quick to answer our questions, we had issues connecting to the Wifi and they provided us another one"
"The Good: Location is amazing, walking distance from Eiffel Tower and metro station. You can plan to go anywhere anytime. It‚Äôs safe location , all restaurants around and everyone will enjoy their vacation plan. The BAD: Host don‚Äôt check if basic necessity things are working. Like vent fan in toilet, windows are safe (we couldn‚Äôt lock one window and it was wobbly , it was so hot and the only portable fan they had in the room was not working,  bathroom  handle rod where shower mounted was crazy loose (very small shower you need to hold to balance) , hair dryer was broken. Host don‚Äôt check these items and once you are there there is no one to fix these issues. Even bathroom sink had drainage issue. It was bad overall  The Ugly: Host is very strict about not check in before 3 pm and checkout must be by 10 am. The building code given to us was wrong, we had to wait outside until 4 pm with my wife (with all luggage) who was not feeling well and the person in charge had no keys. We had to call Airbnb to escalate the issue and could check in after 4PM. Host is not maintaining the basic needs of guest. After I shared the videos I got some discount."
"The place has a metro station and supermarkets nearby. The apartment was a little dusty, and it affected my allergic condition a little."
"Lucie's place is close to the metro station and right across from a wonderful grocery store and does have an elevator up - so no stairs. Note that she is quite a way out of Paris so plan on 30-45 minutes to get into the center.  When we arrived, the place was a mess.  There were dirty dishes in the dishwasher.  We had to wipe down the closet drawers prior to unpacking as they were covered in dust.  In the bathroom, the toilet bowl had dirt and urine on it. There was a dirty towel hanging in the bathroom. The floor needed to be washed. Lucie had all kinds of personal items everywhere, which gave limited space, things like a hair brush, LOTS of toys, and just junk. There were three of us and we spent about 45 minutes each cleaning prior to unpacking.  There were no top sheets and I asked twice on this. Although the apartment sleeps three, it is very tiny with little space to unpack. The ‚Äúdressing room‚Äù that she mentions is not wide enough for most people to stand in. Note that there is NO microwave or air conditioning as stated - only a small fan.  She also states that it has an ""American Kitchen"" it is not. I am not sure what she means by this but as an American it is not. The stove and oven were very difficult to figure out how to use.  Lucie is very responsive through Airbnb but speaks no English at all nor does her friend who checked us in.   The apartment was as good price which is partly why we chose it, that and at the time there wasn‚Äôt much else available.  Overall, I would NOT recommend this apartment. Maybe our visit was a mishap but based on our experience, I would not recommend.  "
"The place is really well located. 2 minutes away from Montorgueil and so close to many tube stations to get anywhere really quickly Communications with the host was smooth and we had not issue entering the flat. It‚Äôs a code on the door so no stress with keys. They were really responsive with all our questions. Internet and TV was working perfectly.  On the down side, as most Airbnb‚Äôs in Paris, it lacks some personal touch in the flat and a couple of things were broken . It‚Äôs on the second floor so quite dark as well. There was no dishwasher and no oven with limited kitchen appliance. We were working from home for a week and this was quite annoying to us. The bed isn‚Äôt really comfortable either."
"The apartment is well located and close to almost everything you'd like to see in Paris that was good, what I didn't like at all was the behavior of the host, I'm going to explain better now. Me and my mother (60 Years old) arrived in port Maillot from Paris Beauvais on Monday 30th around 11:15 am, Salom√® was waiting for us but she gave me a very short time for getting to her place because she told me that she had to go to the doctor around 11 :45 since we were on holiday and we didn't want to run we decided to take our time, no rush but that meant that we had to keep our baggage with us all day until 19 pm, hour when she was finally back home, the first day we had the check in two hours later not at 17 pm as she wrote in the description, anyway what was absurd was the check-out day, our flight from Paris Beauvais was at 20:50 PM so I kindly asked her if we could let our luggage to her place until 16:30 PM so we could enjoy free the last day in Paris and she replies no that we couldn't because she had new guests arriving so even the last day we had to keep our luggage with us and obviously they were heavier than the first day. She gave me a wrong information she sad that we could have paid a deposit in the major's stations and let the luggage there, that wasn't true because after acts of terrorism they don't let you leave the luggage on the station for avoiding that someone could let a bomb inside at the end we lost our last day in Paris, another problem was the Bathroom in my opinion not really clean"
Philip is a very nice host. He helped me a lot. The location is great. 5 min away from louvre in taxi and 10 min walking from gare du nord train station.  Its not a fancy apartment. ITs good for young people that will spend the day in the streets and just get back home to sleep. So if u r travelling with friends its a good place to save money. It has no elevator so it was kinda tired to get all the luggage to the apartment that is in the second floor.  The building is kinda old so dont expect a fancy place.  Theres a restaurant downstairs with good food. If u r travelling with old people it may not be the perfect option but u would probably need to pay some extra money for another place.
"The location is good with Metro and bus stations as well as cafes and supermarkets nearby and the canal area is nearby. The studio apartment is large enough to feel roomy.  Big windows overlook Rue du Faubourg Saint-Martin and the Gar de l''Est train station.  The host left ear plugs by the bed, but we had no problem with noise, probably since he recently replaced the windows.   A spiral staircase  to reach the apartment.  There is no microwave oven if you want to heat up leftovers, but not realy a problem."
"The flat is good, located close to main train station which is convenient. The only down side is that area is occupied by African and Muslim community and seems dirty and dangerous."
"We arrived to Paris before check in time. So we messaged Loic to see if we can drop our baggage off so we can go explore until check in time. He immediately responded and Sacha was already at the flat to let us in and explain how everything works. She also informed us that there was no toilet paper but she would be getting some. The lock of the door was a bit tricky but she walked us though that and it was fine once we got the hang of it. When we returned to the flat later, there was still no toilet paper but after telling Loic, Sacha immediately brought some and croissants for our troubles. The location is fantastic. Very close to the metro station. And very close to the Eiffel Tower!"
"well located close to metro station and enough space for 4 people. however, might need to be cautious around the station area, it doesn't feel the safest place"
"to quick stay in Paris. Close to the Metro station, localisation is great. Area is quite laud because of Train Station really near. Flat seem to be nice, but cleanliness (used, dirty underwear on the corner of sofa and hairs everywhere), lack of trust and hospitality for guests (a lot of shelfs and cupboards locked by chains) and lack of set of bed sheets for 3rd guest make our stay poor. That was my first experience with Airbnb and I‚Äôm so dissapointed and probably I won‚Äôt use this service anymore."
"Alb√©ric CANCELLED MY RESERVATION ON THE EVENING OF MY FAMILY‚ÄôS ARRIVAL. I had communicated with Alb√©ric about my travel plans during the weeks leading up to our stay in his apartment. Only after this terrible situation did I learn that Alb√©ric had issues with no running water in his apartment at least a month prior to my scheduled stay and he had cancelled several other guests in July leading up to my stay.  I was in the London train station at 19:30, waiting to board the Eurostar to Paris, when I saw an email from Alb√©ric saying he had to cancel my stay starting that night. He had only sent the email two hours before I noticed it. Due to the very late cancellation, he should have called me right away. After reading the email, I immediately responded asking if what I read was true. After his response I asked if he could recommend another place to stay‚Äîanything, like a hotel. Alb√©ric offered no assistance and no effort, only a ‚ÄúHope you find a place.‚Äù  When we finally arrived at Gare du Nord late that night at 23:30, my wife and I scrambled to make phone calls to many hotels just to find a last-minute available room for the night. The rest of our stay in Paris cost us considerably more money because we had to find a last-minute hotel to stay for the rest of our trip.  I do NOT RECOMMEND Alb√©ric as an AirBnB host. If the ‚Äúno running water‚Äù situation was true, √Ålberic should have taken responsibility for assisting us with an alternative place to stay, as he was well aware of our late-night arrival from London. Alb√©ric demonstrated a serious neglect and lack of consideration for his guests."
"We did not meet Alexis but Ann was there to welcome us to show us the ropes and give us the BAD NEWS - there is no HOT WATER SUPPLY.  We checked in on Wednesday and the plumber only came in to check the following Monday but still NO HOT WATER.  We stayed for 7 nights without hot water which was of great inconvenience  notwithstanding Alexis did compensate us.  Its either icy cold shower  or no shower. Other than the NO HOT WATER issue the location of the apartment was great - very convenient and close to all amenities - metro station, cafes, supermarkets, places of interest and shopping"
"I stayed in Edith's flat in Paris for 18 days and the flat has everything you need for a short or long stay. There are supermarkets and boulangeries within a short walking distance from the flat and there are metro stations within 7 minutes walk from the flat. Edith was polite  and was very responsive to any queries.  One of the big downsides of this listing is the downstairs neighbour who is VERY VERY sensitive to noise of any type.  Edith mentioned that we had to keep noise to a minimum during our stay, which is normal for any stay in an apartment building, but I had no idea the neighbour was so sensitive to noise that even 'walking ' across the floor of the flat was a major problem for them. I had only checked in for 1 hour and as I was unpacking and familiarising myself with the flat the neighbour rang my doorbell like a crazy person for ages. I  was pretty upset as didn't really want to stay for such a long time (18 days) with a psycho neighbour. I contacted Edith but she would not let me out of the booking. The neighbour unfortunately doesn't understand that with apartment living there will be some noise from time to time. I found that I had to tip toe around in the flat  for the entire booking so I didn't upset the neighbour which was very stressful. This had a major impact on my stay in this flat and pretty much spoilt my holiday in Paris.  The bed linen and towels are worn and need replacing, I have recommended this to the host.  The computer (TV) stopped working during my stay due to the Bluetooth mouse batteries running out. I couldn't find any replacement batteries in the flat so no TV for last few days of the booking.  There was cigarette smoking smell coming from the flat next door which I could smell whilst I was cooking food in the kitchen."
"Near to a few metro stations and Bastille market that sell cheap fresh goods. There are supermarkets nearby as well. The kitchen facilities is good: oil, salt, pasta, coffee and tea were provided. Car park is available as well but we did not utilise it as we were not driving. A nice place to stay but probably not during summer :)"
"Lovely, nicely decorated place. It's also well located and about a 2 minute walk from the Place de Clichy metro station. Just remember there is no elevator, which was no issue for us. But for some tourists who spent the day walking around Paris and then coming home to 4 flights of stairs this might not be ideal.  However, my personal negative was the smell of cigarettes throughout the apartment. Fortunately no one in our party had any allergies or sensitivities to this, but it definitely wasn't pleasant."
"The location is great as you can see the Eiffel Tower out the window just a few blocks away. It's also close to Metro stations and has grocery stores, restaurants, corner stores and pharmacies nearby. Marc was a very responsive host who answered our questions in a timely manner. The place is very clean and modern and was bigger than expected for Paris places. The negative issues we encountered were: * the listing simply says the apartment has air conditioning but doesn't says it's portable units and that there are only two. One was broken and the end of the exhaust hose of the other was simply lying on the bedroom floor - not vented outside the window - so it was blowing all the hot air it removed from the room, back into the room. * the master bedroom door suddenly locked with all our stuff inside and the property manager didn't reply within the promised 1hr time limit so we had to fix the issue."
"We booked this place based on the recommendations from the other reviewers. We had a disappointing experience.  For starters- this place is really tiny and it was extremely cramped with our luggage. It‚Äôs at least 2 train stations away from Montmartre so don‚Äôt expect the Montmartre feel from this neighborhood. The train station is close by.  The beds linens did not feel freshly washed, there was a lot of dust on the bed frames and under the bed.  And lastly, the reason we had to cut our stay short was because there was no hot water for 2 days (no hot showers!!). Since the owner was in a different city, he said he would send someone to fix it but it wasn‚Äôt done on the first day. I decided to give him another day to fix it, but the owner was unresponsive on the 2nd day. We lost an entire day of our limited time in Paris trying to figure this out with no resolution. It was pretty stressful (and expensive) for me to try and find another place for moving to on the same day. Especially because we had 2 young kids.  This was a deal breaker for me so we contacted AirBnB and checked out."
"The accommodation has the potential to be a very good place. Unfortunately we encountered several issues which we believe need to be rectified as they create an unsafe environment.  The ceiling has several places where rain leaks through. Mould was starting to form on some areas with pieces of plaster falling off the ceiling during our stay. We did advise by SMS on our 2nd day. Another area of concern is out of the owners control is the local pizza shop leaves the front security door open at night, this could lead to a security risk. There is a second security door but it is sometimes left ajar due to the locking mechanism not engaging unless the door is shut with force.  Other minor issues like no toilet paper and quality of towels also affected out stay. Overall the place has lots of potential, it is right next to the train station and convenient to get to the city and airport. We have been offered a refund of one night's accommodation for the inconvenience, not received as yet."
Clean and comfy apartment with some nice places to eat very nearby. However the 5 flights of stairs are a challenge for  those who are not so fit.  The location is very close to the heart of Montmartre.... unfortunately this seems questionable at all times. Be very careful of pickpocketers. We were unfortunate victims on the local metro when only travelling  2 stations üòì
"The apartment is smaller than what you may think. Very well located near restaurants, train stations, mini marts, etc. The restaurants are the reason why you will be ""entertained"" until very late at night wether you like it or not. Upon arrival, there was a horrible smell coming from the bathroom and stayed that way for two days. Not sure if we just got used to it, or vented out after we opened the two windows. We wanted to close the windows and have the AC on, but as it is regulated from outside, all we could get is the heater on (way too warm). We had an issue while entering the facility (entirely my fault..), but did notice that it took a few hours to get a response (luckily for us we figure out our mistake before getting a response). We also had no detail as to what to do with the trash and took two days to get an answer. As an ex-Superhost myself, I expected more based on what I provide my guests."
"The host was waiting and showed us around.  There was a book with instructions for use of TV and appliances which was helpful.  He gave us a way to contact him if it was needed.  Stores and restaurants were close, as were 2 transit stations.  There were a couple of places we could walk, in spite of it being a busy neighbourhood.  "
"Odelia is a lovely host and her place has a great location near Blanche station. The area is quite touristy and is crowded both at day and night-time, so you won‚Äôt feel anxious while returning home late in the evening. The flat itself has all necessary amenities, except the blow dryer. The only inconvenience was the broken mirror but it shouldn‚Äôt bother you if you‚Äôre not that superstitious :)"
"We stayed at Adrien's place for 6 nights. The apartment is as shown on the pictures. The neighbourhood is quiet and there are a couple of public transport stations nearby. But be prepared that Paris is a big city, and it takes 30 mins to get around and into the city centre. Montmatre is in walking distance, which is nice. Unfortunately, the apartment was not clean at all. The dishes were dirty, so we needed to wash and clean everything by hand once again. On the floor and in the corners, you could still find dust and dirt. The air was on the first day also smelly. One of the towels was still wet when we wanted to use it and started to smell moldy. Also, the radiators were so dirty that we didn't want to dry the towels on them.  The beds (normal one and sofa) were noisy when moving around, even though we were not that heavy. However, they were relatively comfortable. Overall the stay was okayish, but would not stay for a second time."
"Before you read the rest, to SweetInn's credit, we received a full refund for our stay. First we couldn't get into our rental for the night because we were sent the wrong codes and there was no clear indication of which apartment was ours.  We eventually succeeded by deducing the correct code from the two wrong codes sent to us (1234, which worked on floor 4 and 1231).  Our floor was floor 3; try to guess what our code was. Then, after leaving the apartment for dinner, we came back to find 2 laptops, a cellphone, and a few sets of headphones had been stolen from our rental with no sign of forced entry.  This led to many hours talking with a representative from SweetInn and with the French Police (who were quite friendly!), ending at the local police station at about 5 am. We believe that the inadequate security measures on the apartment lock-boxes was what allowed someone to easily break into our rental and steal our belongings.  And that's the fault of SweetInn."
"Vanessa and Cedric‚Äôs place was as described/photographed. You can see the attention to details inside the apartment. Check in was easy if you pay attention to their instructions which was detailed. Please note that this apartment is on 1st floor without lift (which was mentioned) and as most European bldgs, staircase is bit narrow but it helped to know beforehand. Just a around 6mins walk to Sacre Couer there are a lot of groceries near the area. Metro station and bus stop is a short walk."
This place is very close to the center of Paris. You can also get to other less convenient by nearby(also extremely close) station. Apartment is spacious with many of essentials covered. However the sofa bed is not stable with constant creaking sound. But it does the job if you just need a bed to sleep in
"Clara‚Äôs house has a great location. It is less than 1 minute to central metro station. There is no security risk. Everything is clean. The only disadvantage is that the house is a little bit small. But we did not stay at home too much, so it wasn‚Äôt a problem for us."
"This comfortable apartment is located in a quiet and safe neighborhood. There is a shopping mall across the street with a grocery store in the basement. Bus stops are very near by and two subway stations are within a 10 minute walk from the apartment. The only reason I gave it four stars is that the Airbnb listing said it has central air conditioning, which it does not. I hope the host will correct this. You can open the bedroom and living room windows at night since it's on the fifth floor to get some air circulation. One confusing thing about finding the apartment is that the entire block has the same street address. However, all of the other places on this short block are businesses and the apartment building is the only one behind a black iron fence and gate. The host met us outside the gate and showed us the apartment."
"We was a party of 7 people and even the place has to bathrooms, there‚Äôs only ONE toilet in the whole house. Just one bathtub, but it was broken.  The WiFi is unreliable and doesn‚Äôt cover the whole place.  The main tv at the living room was broken or had signal issues. Two fans of the whole place. It was unbelievably HOT. And on top of all that, there‚Äôs an ANTS infestation.  Even the host tried. It‚Äôs  very disappointed to get in a place that according with the information is great and then you found out it‚Äôs not even close.  If you‚Äôre on Paris on holidays the last thing you would like to do is keep calling and getting calls from the Hostess to get stuff fixed.  I have been always skeptical of using AB&B. This was my first and last time"
"i would like to start with positive note, the llocation of this place is good close to the train station and restuaurants, though they are not great restaurnants and not worth the money and very average taste (would rather eat in the trolley pancake near nort dame). Inside the house was neat and amenities same as mentioned  I dont wanto sound too neagtive, but will never stay in this palce and will never recommed this place again, you can get a better place for this price in the saem suburb or in Latin Quarters. These people did not mention this is at the 4th floor with no lift access, the stairs are very narrow and you cannot take the big suitcase up the stairs, i travelled from Australia with my 2 sons and we had 3 big suitcase and 2 small suitcase as we travelled around europe and this accomodation is the great mistake i have done, rest all accomodations in Europe was really good. We could not take the suitcases upto the 4th floor and ended up dragging and broke the suitcase wheel,"
"For first stay in Paris, you can't ask for better location.  Grocery store just downstairs, 5 min walk to two metro stations. 20min walk to Louvre, 30min to St. Germain and Marais.  It is tiny as it's said. If you have more than 2 luggages‚Äã it'll be really tight. "
A nice location not too far away from the centre of Paris. Riquet metro station is about 5 mins walk. Buses are a few minutes away too.  A nice sized apartment. Kept very clean. There was a microwave and electric hob but no oven. WiFi was good. No tv or music system.  Small handtowels in the bathrooms only.  My one big problem was the very small lift which was the only way in and out of the apartment. This is shared with all other apartments on the other eight floors. There are no emergency stairs. If there was a problem you have two ways out: use the small shared lift or over the balcony and eight floors straight down. Neither option is safe.
"The good: This apartment is only a 5 minute walk to the Metro train station. It is modern inside, and the bathroom and kitchen have modern appliances. To note: the address written on the Airbnb site is not the actual address of the apartment (which is sent to you by the host the day before you arrive).   It is in the 'mini-Africa' area of Paris and there are many stalls along the streets. Look up ""Goutte d 'Or"". The bad: we followed the instructions to get in through the main door, but there was no response from the person who was supposed to let us in. We ended up messaging the host through Airbnb and were eventually let in, after standing on the street for approx 20 minutes.  The apartment is being renovated, and the electrical wiring in the ceiling of the apartment is exposed."
Fantastic location but unfortunately the apartment was not the cleanest on arrival. Their was a lot of mould on window furnishings and ceiling. The get a key host  did organize for someone to come and clean it the next day however by the end of our stay it was back. Their is alot of damage to the floor which was quiet dangerous. The towels (2) only for a 5 night stay were the worst quality we have ever had in an Airbnb property they were threadbare and very small. We asked for more however that was declined. The ad states shampoo and soap and toilet paper etc supplied however all the dispensers were empty so that was a false statement. It also says their is a work station which does not exist. My son was staying in same apartment block but on level 5 I would highly recommend finding that one if this is location you want to stay  as it was very clean had lots of linen supplied and much better quality. Even had a swipe for access instead of 3 different codes. Overall wouldn‚Äôt recommend .
"Good location near a major rail station in Paris. I slept on a sofa bed which wasn't very well padded, but because I was tired, it didn't bother me too much, and I was able to fall asleep quickly."
"This property is in a good location - very close to a metro station and a lot of restaurants and cafes.  There was a place for all 14 of us to sleep fairly comfortably.  We arrived shortly before the 3pm check-in time, and saw that the key box was open and empty. It was unclear that the unit was being cleaned, so we were concerned that the key had not been left for us.  The entrance is in an ally, so we just waited on the sidewalk until the cleaning was finished about 20 minutes after the 3pm check-in.    The unit was nicely cleaned.  Because there are very few windows, it was very warm and stuffy, and 2 of the 5 fans did not work.  One coffee maker didn't work, and the other leaked all over the counter.  My brother-in-law was able to fix the first coffee maker.  The shower in the upstairs master bath was very mildewed, and flooded after 60 seconds.  The shower head was not mounted to the wall, so had to be hand-held.  The mattress supports of one of the upstairs twin beds fell out the first night.  We were able to put them back in, but they fell out easily again.  The upstairs ceiling leaked in several places, causing some slippery puddles, and dripping on us while using one of the toilets. The above things were inconvenient, and need to be fixed.  However, my main complaint is that Joffrey only responded to my communication at check-in to let me know that the cleaning service had finished.  When I contacted him about the leaks, shower drain, fans, coffee maker and broken bed, he did not respond, and I haven't heard from him since.  When I didn't hear from him, I copied my message to Airbnb Customer Service.  Although they followed up with me to see if the issues were resolved, they weren't able to do anything about them. If I had received a message from Joffrey, even if he had said he would not be able to fix the issues during our stay, and possibly apologizing for our inconvenience, I would have gladly gone without posting a negative review."
"Very nice, close to the train station . The only downside is that the blanket was not the best and i had a allergic reaction to it"
"The apartment is nice inside and has everything you need and it is right in front of the metro station. The building is very old and has no maintenance and the stairs are narrow and the apartment is on the 3rd floor. The neighborhood is very bad and seems dangerous, even had a fight 200 meters from the apartment in a restaurant called FOOD HOUSE that was very badly frequented. The person who greeted us when we arrived did not speak English and this made it a little difficult, mainly because the subway was closed because of the strike and we had to figure out how to walk alone in an extremely dangerous neighborhood. I believe that if the subway were working, we would have a better stay because there would be no need to walk around the neighborhood."
"We faced some problems , the walls are very thin and unfortunately every night and morning we have been disturbed because of this issue. As the rest of reviews emphasize the problem with the matress, for us was a problem too.  Besides these, everything is ok. The location is very well placed, near a metro station."
"Neat apartment, close to metro station (Strasbourg - Saint Denis), supermarket, fast foods, restaurants. In red light are but it is no problem. Apartment is in 1st floor, so need to climb a stair."
"Perfect location meaning we could make the most of our stay. Disappointed with a couple of things- the bed/pillows were rather uncomfortable, once we had arrived we asked about the wifi and were told it was broken and were not made aware that the nearby metro station (Ch√¢telet) was closed. It was our first time using the metro and it meant that the directions we were provided with were useless. The size of apartment was made very clear in the information and reviews- very small!"
"Our family very much enjoyed our stay in this charming apartment. It is located on a quiet street but still with plenty to do within several blocks: multiple metro stations, restaurants, cafes, bakeries, pastry shops, gym, etc. Also, within a 20 - 25 minute walk, you can reach the park in front of the Eiffel Tower, Rue Cler (pedestrian street with speciality food shops for a picnic), La Grande Epicerie (high-end food shop), Jardin du Luxembourg (amazing park), etc. Our only complaint was the bed in the master room was too hard. We ended up sleeping in the other bedroom with our kids taking our first bed."
"The flat was located in a very nice area close to restaurants and various bars. There were plenty of grocery stores just nearby, as well as metro stations and the Chatelet-Les Halles train station. There is a quite busy road next to the flat, but the windows isolate the sound very well, so it did not bother us at all. It is also located on the top floor so you get a beautiful view. The apartment was very spacious, and you could use the sofa bed if you had any guests coming over. It was equipped with most of the things you need such as cutlery, pots and pans, glasses, etc. There is also a dishwasher and washing machine. However, most of the equipment and the apartment itself are quite worn down, and we experienced several problems with the equipment. On a more serious note, the communication with the host was very bad. It could take up to several days and several messages before they would answer. When we experienced problems with some of the equipment it would take forever for it to even get looked at. For example, when we experienced a problem with the oven/microwave not being able to start, it took 8 days before someone came to look at it and fix it. This is something you should keep in mind. Also, there is no mailbox available for you to use. All in all, the location was great, the apartment was very spacious with two decent bedrooms. However, if you experience any problems, it will probably take a while before getting it fixed."
"Nice and stylish modern renovated apartment with sufficient space for a group of 8. Ideally located in a central area with 3 metro station in walking distance. Bedrooms are quiet as they are in the backyard.  Unfortunately, during our stay of 5 days water was dropping down from the ceiling, which was irritating and rather annoying. Regrettably the host was not able to repair the problem during our whole stay - despite the promise given upon arrival."
"On a positive note, the bed is comfortable and the room is modern and clean. Unfortunately however, the positives of this accommodation are overshadowed by a number of negatives. First off the hotel surrounding is littered with an immense amount of broken glass that was not cleaned during our 3 day stay. We witnessed rats (plural) running through the lower decks and they will run right at you. There is a restaurant to the right of the pool and a coffee station in a room to the left of the pool. We were informed at check in that if we wanted to use the restaurant after 5 it was best to make a reservation however the coffee station and the room to the left was available to hotel patrons 24/7. Pool closes at an early 5.30pm. What we were not told was that the area surrounding the pool was part of the restaurant and that we were not allowed to sit at the tables around the pool without checking with the restaurant. Also the room with the coffee station is not available to hotel guests 24/7 as we were incorrectly informed. My husband and I discovered all of this when we went to make a coffee. The staff were setting up lunch or snacks in the room to the left so we took our coffee outside to the pool area in an attempt to be out of their way. One of the restaurant staff came storming out and angrily instructed us to sit down on the lower deck. We tried to explain we were hotel guests but that made no difference. We also tried to explain that we were not comfortable sitting there because of the rats. There were 3 other groups also outside on the tables who were not told to move until we queried why we were the only ones requested to. Strange paying for a hotel with a pool then not being able to use the tiny space surrounding it. The restaurant staff were extremely argumentative when we raised our concerns about being made to feel uncomfortable. The air of unnecessary snobbery amongst the restaurant staff overshadows what could be a great hotel. On top of cleaning staff constantly walking into our room without knocking and a couple of times while we had just stepped out of the shower (no inside locks on doors), our entire stay left us feeling on edge, uncomfortable and unwelcome. Reception staff were very apologetic which we appreciated but on the whole it is difficult spending money somewhere when you are uncertain about where you can and cannot go  and are treated so poorly by the staff."
"I‚Äôll start with the positives: - apartment is very spacious  - hosts were able to arrange for same-day reservation and check-in - centrally located around restaurants and metro stations  Negatives: - wifi only works in half of the house, and is completely unavailable in main bedroom and half of living room - hosts sent a repair person while I was out of the house, without me requesting any repairs, and without prior notification, and the repair person moved my belongings in the bedroom - apartment is very noisy at night - I‚Äôm a light sleeper, so perhaps I‚Äôm too sensitive to this, but I see others have made the same comment. All of the bedrooms are very close to the street, so there was no escaping the sound - host attempted to communicate details of check-in and check-out off platform via another app, which led to confusion and unnecessary hassle - after leaving unclear checkout instructions, I followed their guidance to leave everything in the apartment, and after I left, they requested $200+ as compensation for me ‚Äúleaving the key in the apartment‚Äù. This was outrageous because the apartment is accessible via passcode, and the cleaners could easily have accessed the apartment without the swipe card. Left a bad taste in my mouth‚Ä¶"
"Worth the price, walking distance to eiffel tower, just a block from metro station."
"We arrived after 7 pm because our flight was delayed and the traffic was slow. But the welcomer was waiting for us patiently. Julien's place looks very like the photos. It is close to a station and some restaurants.  We booked three nights but unfortunately we had to leave after the first night due to the problem of the flying bugs everywhere. It really put us to a nervous night because my son is allergic to bugs bite. Also, we didn't have enough blanket for to sleep on the couch. They were wet and hanging. But overall, if I have chance to go to Paris again (perhaps by myself), I will have no doubt to stay in Julien's place again."
"This property is located in the heart of the fancy 6th district of Paris. In this neighborhood you may find restaurants, laundromats, fashionable stores, art galleries, etc. Moreover, it has great connectivity as there is a nearby metro station and several bus stops. It is also close to famous landmarks, such as the Luxembourg Garden and the Saint-Sulpice church. The apartment itself is small, but has most of what you may need. There are a few things that make longer stays a little uncomfortable, especially related to the toilet. Firstly, it is too small, as the shower and toilet bowl are not separated by a curtain or wall and share the same space. Secondly, after flushing the toilet, the tank takes a long time to fill again (about 10 minutes), which is annoying for two guests. Thirdly, the toilet door is transparent and is on the way to the exit of the property, which is also bothersome for two guests. Lastly, there is no washbasin in the toilet, so you have to wash your hands using the sink in the kitchen. There were other problems related to the state of the property upon our arrival: some places were not clean, and the bed and shower support were broken. The owner of the property had to address these problems while we away and in the end they were solved. The communication with the hosts was great. They responded quickly and answered to all of our requests. The check-in time was later than expected, which was troublesome as we had to wait outside while carrying our luggage during a rainy day. Overall, it is a reasonable apartment in a great location. It may be worth it for the price and location if you are aware of the issues."
"The apartment‚Äôs prime location near a metro station, surrounded by restaurants and supermarkets, is ideal for metro travelers, though driving by car is challenging due to parking garage. Situated on the ground floor within a courtyard, it‚Äôs convenient for those with lots of luggage but offers less privacy. However, the sofa bed may not be comfortable for longer stays, making it more suitable for shorter visits. Despite this, I would stay again during weekend trips to Paris."
"Very nice place and located in a very busy street. Near to metro station, so is convenient to go anywhere. The unit is quite spacious for us with 3 people. The only downside I would say is the slightly lower pressure of bathroom hot water."
"It‚Äôs 10-15 min. by walking to the subway station, half an hour to triumphal arch ÂáØÊóãÈó®Ôºå5 min. to the supermarket. It was 40-43 degree, without air conditioning, a very small electrical fans didn‚Äôt help. I made a big mistake to have changed from a 4 star hotel with air conditioning near Eiffel Tower into this apartment at the same price.  And it‚Äôs very difficult to communicate with the owner for checking in and checking out time. We had to drive very quick from Tours to reach her time at 10:45 in the morning, then couldn‚Äôt arrive on time since drove wrong way in Paris and then couldn‚Äôt leave the luggage, then we must return at 3 pm for checking in.  Also we had to check out at 10:00 in the morning, even our flight is in the evening. You can leave at any time your luggage in the hotel.  The owner lives here when no guests. It‚Äôs not so beautiful as the photos which were made under sunshine, you cannot see the real situation, noisy floor. The kitchen is full with cooking things, but quite old. Won‚Äôt return and recommend. We must tell the truth!"
"Getting to Filipe‚Äôs place wasn‚Äôt easy as his instructions weren‚Äôt clear. I had to call Airbnb and report a problem as we couldn‚Äôt find the key for the apartment based on his pictures/guide how to get in. In 30 min of trying, we finally figured it out and found the key.  Felipe‚Äôs place was just 5 min walking distance from Pasteur metro station. Great for visitors who will use the public transportation. Apartment was cold during our stay 4/21 - 4/28. I was told by the host there‚Äôs no heat available after 4/15. There were no extra blankets available as well. Keep that in mind. Place was cozy and comfortable but fairly dusty. Walking around in my socks, they looked terrible dirty in just a stroll around the apartment and I could see long hair stuck on them. The place wasn‚Äôt really vacuumed at all. Felipe had a list of checking out instructions on the door. One was about taking the garbage out to a specific floor which we had to get to with the elevator. Bad instructions-couldn‚Äôt find it."
"It's well location (~25 minutes to go walk to Louvre,/Montmartre), some meters to metro station. Room is a little bit small, few lights in the room, there is no fridge in the room as well. Breakfast is ok, but no big choice."
"Pros: The location is perfect, right above the train station which also has a mall, a Starbucks, and a Brioche Doree.  It‚Äôs right across from a supermarket. The view is incredible.  Cons: The hosts‚Äô knowledge of the area seems to be limited. We stayed over NYE and when I asked for suggestions on what to do during New Years Day, the host couldn‚Äôt help me.  The AirBnB can technically sleep 3 (2 in the bed and 1 on the couch), but whoever is sleeping on the couch will have a difficult time sleeping soundly, as the cats terrorize the apartment every night around 3:30 am."
"Apartment is in a fabulous part of the Quartier Latin, with great accessibility to many sites (walking distance of Pantheon, Jardin Luxembourg, multiple metro stations, the Seine, Notre Dame Basilica, Le Marais, etc.), however VERY loud at night due to nearby bars and restaurants, as well as church bells directly next door that ring every hour and half an hour all day long. Perfect for 1-2 people, ideally 'younger' guests, but no more. Arrange for an email address or some other way to touch base with Fran prior to arriving, as our international phone plans did not allow us to call or text him, and we only had access to his French phone number. Also, plan your check in and check out procedures with Fran before your arrival to avoid confusion once you're arrived in Paris."
"Pros: Sarah's apartment is located in Montmartre, which is in close proximity to the Basilica of Sacre-Coeur and Moulin Rouge. There was also a metro station within walking distance, as well as many restaurants. Check-in was fairly easy, although early check-in was denied. I unfortunately did not get to meet Sarah upon our arrival, so we picked up the key in a lock box in a nearby restaurant. Sarah used the HostnFly application to assist with communication during our stay. Any time I reached out to Sarah, she responded in a timely manner. Cons: Unfortunately, the apartment was not as clean as expected. The shower was a bit dirty, and the water turned cold after about 2 minutes. The floors had not been swept prior to our arrival. The wifi network that was listed on the HostnFly application was inaccurate. You will have to look at the modem itself and type in the password to get the correct information if the network isn't working. The most disappointing thing about our stay in Sarah's apartment was that we were blamed for causing damage to a cabinet door in the kitchen, when we hadn't even cooked, therefore having absolutely no reason to open any cabinet doors in the first place! It is a shame because had we met Sarah at the apartment when checking-in, I feel as though this situation would have been non-existent. I have never had an issue with Airbnb or any of their hosts, however, I am sad to say that this has changed my perspective."
Centrally located one-bedroom apartment with a Metro station just outside the alley. No noises at all and has all one needs.
"Place is very convenient to 2 main station paris nord and paris est. The downside is it has no lift so you have to carry your heavy lugagges. If you come back very late, there are gatherings near chateau rogue metro, so you will see some typical people. The exit of that metro is very dirty."
"The location is very convenient one block away from the station.  Other than that, our poor review echoes what previous guests said about cleanliness, communication, and the state of the floor."
"For my first Airbnb and my first trip to Paris, my stay could not have been lovelier. Fran√ßoise and her husband live upstairs, and although she does not like to speak English, they made sure I was very comfortable. The bathroom is extremely clean, and the room (which comes with a key) is very spacious. The apartment is slightly away from the center of town but the Metro stations for 2 & 3 are only a block away. Make sure to communicate fully prior to your stay regarding how to enter the building as there is a key code. Finally the room is about 3ish floors up so if you are not good with stairs, this is not the place (or possibly the city) to stay in."
"We stayed at Mariam‚Äôs place for 2 nights 4 adults and 4 kids. The place is exactly as shown in the photos and literally next to the metro station, which is really convenient. Mariam is a great host . I have to mention that we requested last minute to have a baby cot and we also offered to pay it and Mariam not only brought us a brand new cot but she also refused to take extra money from us. This is professional kind of hospitality."
"It‚Äôs close to subway station crime, the host Nathalie is very patient to tell you all those needed information, it has been a good experience."
"The apartment is very well located just steps away from the St. Lazare metro station.  The master bedroom was nice and quiet, but the front bedroom was very noisy from traffic noise and made it difficult to sleep.  We were also surprised to find that there was limited space to put our things because it is the owners' principal place of residence and their clothing, toileteries, food in fridge, clothes in dryer were all still present!"
"The appartement was fine, close to the metro station (5 min walk), but it was a bit dirty, especially the bathroom."
The house wasin a great condition. The location was close to the metro station. But factor in atleast 40 minutes on the metro to get to important landmarks in Paris. Had a lot of issues with the WiFi and the communication with the concierge service was not the best.
"The building is old and the stairs going up to the rooms need to be renovated. There's no lift and we had to carry our bags till the 4th floor. We found A MOUSE right next to our door which speaks a lot about the cleaning. Went to reception and they just told us they would go see our room and offer us another room if it was free. However they  did not contact us anymore after we complained. Heading to our room everyday while being scared of bumping into a mouse or rat is terrible. Definitely not worth paying 90 euros per night for the room. If you don't mind all of this, location was pretty good close to the Pompidou and 2 mins away from supermarket's and a metro station. Wouldn't recommend to anyone because the staff is irresponsive and we also ordered a private taxi to the airport departing at 5:30 AM and nobody was there so we had to wander around the streets till we found a free taxi on our own. The overall experience was a DISASTER."
The apartment was at the third floor without elevator. It has two metro station really close and lots off cheap restaurants at the street. At the night the neighborhood appears too attract young people for drinks but there is no problem with noise. Thank you Florian for your home 
"-Œë very nice place, ideal for 1 or 2 people, because there are 2 rooms and this is very important, well equiped, but there wasn't a clothes rack neither a mop. Great central location, 3 min away from the metro station. Negative points: a lot of powder and humidity.  -Mr Feshyr was very helpful during our stay. He helped us even in opening a French bank account or finding a taxi to the airport. He didn't disturb us at all but he was there everytime we needed him.  -Even though Mr Feshyr had visited the studio 10 days before our departure, he then (after our departure) claimed that we had caused a damage on the floor. Mr Feshyr asked firstly 600‚Ç¨ and then 800‚Ç¨ (!) in addition to the rent, claiming that we had caused a damage to his floor (the material is laminate). The problem was not important, almost invisible. And in any case, the rent was very high, enough to cover any normal damages caused by the normal use of a studio, in which 2 people stay for 5 months. Generally we really respected his studio, we even bought a few things and we left them in the apartment so that they complete the studio‚Äôs equipment."
"The apartment was clean and perfect for a group of 4 people. Location was great, with subway stations close by. We could use some extra towels and a dryer (the washing machine was wash only), but, other than that, no complaints."
"It's not a really nice place but the price is really good, Anthony was helpful and welcoming.  It had no privacy since the door of the room is a curtain, the bathroom was really little and it was hard to shower in there. The apartment is in the 5th floor and there is no elevator, just stairs. Well located, metro station in a 2 minutes walk and 25 minutes metro to the city centre. It has supermarkets nearby and a nice area of bars and restaurants nearby (10-15 minutes walk). Anthony gave us some tips on the city and where to eat, that was very helpful. I was a bit disappointed by the place but, really, for that price it's hard to complain and I didn't spend much time in the apartment, it was just a place to sleep."
"Location is really good,  close to metro stations and just minutes walk from Bastille. Loads of restaurants around and a Carrefour next door. The bathroom can be dangerous for old people. Self check in was a bit confusing for us, especially at night time."
The 3 photos posted show a clean and tidy place to stay. But never expect to see so many personal items in the house. Quite a mess in the toilet with no space to place my toiletries. Owner should be responsible to keep away her belonging and tidy up her house to allow more space for airbnb customer. The place is kind of small for my family with teenages. Overall compensated by the convenience location with train station just opposite.
"Unrealistic check in and check out timing. Hot water wasn‚Äôt working and had trouble using the shower and water would splash out of the bath tub. For the amount we paid the pillow was horrible, they did not provide proper pillows, super horrible and European pillows. The host gave us empty promise of early check in and we ended up waiting for 3 hrs in the train station and did not even respond to our msg. The worst part was we could literally hear our next door people from our room. Horrible! Check in timing was 4pm and we had to check out at 10am. His cleaning assistant knocked on your door at 9.25 asking us to check out! Had to tell her to come back at 10am. Overall experience was horrible for the amount we paid! Never coming back here again! Shame of these people!"
"Place was a too noisy because of thin walls and noisy station area. Despite that, place was meating minimum needs for few nights stay, the reception is open 24 hours which is very convenient"
"What you see, read and pay , you get specially in the heart of Paris. The two metro station within 4 mins walking distance. Bakery, Laundry, General Store, Cafe, Taxi , ATM, within two minutes. And the most, feel the pulse of Paris.   "
"We had a lovely stay.  The cozy apartment is on 3 levels. We were warned about the stairs which were absolutely no problem for us.  The Canal St Martin area hosts lots of small bars , shops and restaurants.  It‚Äôs 30 minutes walk to the centre or 2 minutes to the nearest tube station."
"PRO :) We liked the location: access to the subway, bus station and restaurants, shops in the area. It was a quiet place CONS :( 1.The address from the ""get direction button"" led us in a wrong direction 2.The person welcoming us wasn't the host. They say in the presentation that the check-in is after 3 p.m. but they didn't say until what hour. Since we needed a late check-in (11 p.m) the host requested us an addicional 20‚Ç¨ for the inconvenience (even though they have the self check-in device in place) 3.The apartament wasn't the same from the photos 4.The smell from the apartament was of dumpness caused by the mold from the wall 5.Even though it was mentioned that we will find shampoo, hair dryer, iron at the place they didn't put it When we complained, he said that he has only one apartament. But during the conversation, he told us that he made a mistake and we were put in a wrong apartment and other people were in ""our"" apartment. At least, he refunded the amount for 1 night of stay"
Small affordable place right next to a metro station in a local area. Great bakery right down the road and tons of places to eat close by. It was a little far from the main attractions but the metro is right next door. I made the mistake of taking Uber‚Äôs everywhere which ended up costing a lot. Nice clean place I loved the balcony but did not like sleeping without a/c. It gets hot in the little room and when you leave the balcony door open mosquitos fly in and attack you in your sleep so that was really the only negative. Bathroom shower is tiny and hard to move in but if you‚Äôre on a budget it‚Äôs a decent place to stay. I think I wouldn‚Äôt have minded the small shower or the size of the room as long as I had a/c in there.
"Easily the WORST airbnb I‚Äôve ever stayed in. The only thing good about the property is its location, which is central and an under 10 min walk from the Opera subway station. It‚Äôs managed by an agency called Checkmyguest, and they don‚Äôt give a damn if you are able to even enter the apartment. We had to wait for several hours on EACH day of our stay for some building resident to come and let us in. Why? Because the property forgot to share the building code - and were unresponsive on this for all  3 days while we lived there! The apartment was filthy. The appliances, especially the washer and dishwasher, were so dirty and smelly as if they hadn‚Äôt been used in years. The same was with the dishes. The oven didn‚Äôt work. The toilet doesn‚Äôt even lock from the inside. There were ZERO condiments for the kitchen. And the apartment is so tiny that it comfortably fits only 2 people. Once the sofa bed opens (for the third person), you literally have to hop on furniture to get to the toilet or the kitchen. Overall - a terrible terrible experience and we wouldn‚Äôt recommend this to anyone - this apartment will just spoil your Paris trip."
"The place was pretty basic and cozy- perfect for a couple and close by a few metro stops to get you to sights conveniently. Benjamin was very good at communicating prior to our stay and arranged for a ‚Äútaxi‚Äù pick us up at the train station. The taxi driver showed us around the apartment and helped with our bags. The elevator is on the the first floor (not ground level) and is tiny but doable and saves you from walking up 4 flights of stairs after you‚Äôve done a lot of time on your feet.  Unfortunately there were some things that put a serious damper on our stay at the apartment, including having the fold-out couch broken without being notified prior to our stay (and there were no extra linens if we did end up using the second bed), not enough towels for two people for nearly a weeks‚Äô stay, the apartment was pretty dusty, and the extra pillows were gross and stained -no extra pillow cases either, the heaters were broken, and not enough toilet paper or paper towels, (especially to make up for not having any hand or kitchen towels).  Because I felt these were one-offs, I tried making some of these suggestions and bringing up our issues to Benjamin, because mostly I was upset we ended up having to go to the laundromat to dry our clothes because the apartment was on the cold side to dry them, and didn‚Äôt have a second bed to use for two guests, he lashed out and brought up that we had needed someone to come out with an extra key because we got locked out (only one key provided, and we didn‚Äôt realize it locked automatically rather than turning a knob to get in and out). He never mentioned the cost of this, and we didn‚Äôt think twice about it being a real issue since the people who came to let us in ended up also taking out the broken heaters at the same time. Overall, we were really disappointed, but most of all by Benjamin‚Äôs reaction to our trying to give him an opportunity to resolve the shortfalls of our stay."
"As they say, location, location, location. This is a very centrally located apartment, and spacious even with seven guests. Very clean, and up to date. some people have noted that although it says elevator, the elevator is not useful. This is correct, but has very little impact on the apartment as it's only 15 steps to get to it. Lots of restaurants, museums, and shops in walking distance. 300 ft, to the nearest metro station. Again the location could not be better."
"Jean-Marie‚Äôs place was spacious especially compared to other homes in Paris. It‚Äôs next to a train station. Thankful his place had no bedbugs at all when it seemed like all of France was in fear of bedbugs. The shower have the potential to overflow, causing a flood of the bathroom. To prevent this he would need to fix it or guest will have to reduce the water flow pressure & use the smaller shower head."
"Overall we had a good stay here - the location is fantastic, with a fresh food market, bakeries, wine bars, etc all within a 2 minute walk of the apartment, and a metro station maybe 500 meters away. Fantastic. The host Benmoine gave easy to follow instructions that made for a smooth arrival. The apartment itself, while small, was fine for our short 4 night trip to Paris, however the amenities we found to be lacking, from the description on Airbnb. The kitchenette could use with a few cheap additions (e.g. chopping board, drying rack) but otherwise fine for cooking up a delicious meal with fresh ingredients from the market in front of the building. We had planned on using the iron and some hanging space for our clothes, but unfortunately neither were present in the apartment during our visit, which was slightly inconvenient. One towel between the two of us may have been an error, and not the end of the world, but again, slightly inconvenient. A word of caution on the bed, it is quite hard and not very comfortable; after the first night we rolled out the sofa bed, which was much more comfortable."
"Had a nice time! I went to see the Women's World Cup and the apartment is a 10 minute walk from the stadium! Had no trouble with the keys or the people in the apartment complex. Was able to check-in in English, as my French is not very good. Easy place to stay. The apartment is not centrally located in Paris. This was perfect for me because I wanted to be near Parc des Princes, and there is a metro station within a 5 minute walk, but be aware if you want to go to more central and western parts of Paris that you will have to take the metro in and out."
"Don't get your hopes up too high when booking this apartment. The space is rather dark because there are only 3 windows to a courtyard and there is only 1 small window that you can open for fresh air. It is located in a VERY lively area where bars are open every day until midnight and you can hear the people sitting on terraces from inside the apartment. It is very easy to reach the apartment and there are supermarkets close by (Market is on your way to subway station Cadet, it's cheaper than Franprix). Dont expect wonderful English from your host, especially not on the phone. The shower door broke down during my stay and Alexandre told me I would not have to pay for it, yet filed a ‚Ç¨2000 claim via Airbnb in which he stated that we broke it on purpose which is not true.  He did not show any sympathy for my friend that got hurt in the accident and had to go the hospital but was only concerned with himself."
"The apartment location couldnt be better! Great accsess to all the main location and to the metro station. The apartment was just enough for family of 5. Great value for money, we sure recommend!!"
"Although the apartment is well situated and close to restaurants, supermarkets and metro stations, at the time of our stay there were several deficiencies that led to a feeling of disappointment. There is no washing machine, iron or ironing board; the bathroom is very cramped and the shower unit and bathroom cupboard need repairs;   the bed collapses; the kitchen lacks basic cleaning supplies; the street is very noisy when the windows are open; dragging suitcases up three flights of stairs was physically challenging."
"We have enjoyed our stay very much. The communication and the warm welcome from dolphin, the friendly host, was exemplary. The apartment is very stylish, clean and convenient. The location in the middle of Montmartre, 5 minutes away from the Sacre Coeur, is fantastic. A lively area with many restaurants, bars, cafes and shops. Metro station very suitable as a base for trips in the city (Ch√¢teau Rouge, no. 4) can be reached in a few minutes. We will be back! Andi & Laura  Wir haben unseren Aufenthalt sehr genossen. Die Kommunikation und der freundliche Empfang mit Delphine, der herzlichen Gastgeberin, war vorbildlich. Die Wohnung ist sehr stilvoll, sauber und praktisch. Die Lage mitten in Montmartre, 5 Minuten entfernt von Sacre Coeur, ist fantastisch. Ein lebendiges Viertel mit vielen Restaurants, Bars, Cafes und Shops. Als Basis f√ºr Ausfl√ºge in die Stadt sehr geeignet, die Metrostation (Chateau Rouge, Nr. 4) ist in wenigen Minuten erreichbar. Wir kommen wieder! Andi & Laura  "
"The place is located near metro station so it is easy to reach all places in the city. It is safe neighborhood near Montmartre. But flat was a little bit cold, we used heater in our room, but in others was cold. Bed was bad: double, but it cried out of the slightest movement, even turning around in it. And walls in flat are very thin, you can hear everything from all sides."
"His accommodation is very close to the Montpanes train station. We were able to rest in the comfort of his home. He responded very quickly. However, I think the charge for damaged dishes or stains on the bed is excessive (despite everything from IKEA..)"
Place was close to the train station. Not sure about leaving key as we were give the wrong one? Very helpful with package
"Perfect location.  Within a block of many cafes.  A cheese shop next door, an organic grocery store two doors away, and a wine shop within 1/2 block.  My wife and I are older (late 60's) but were able to walk to Museums (l'Orangerie, d'Orsay, Louvre), Luxembourg Gardens, and st. Sulpice.  Just steps from a Metro station.  Bank with an ATM next steps away also.  Not a huge apartment, but bigger than most hotel rooms for less rent.  I recommend Imane's place for couples - not ideal for children."
"The room was fantastically located, 10 mins from the louvre and near metro stations. It was clean enough and facilities were fine. It was advertised as a charming typical Parisian apartment and that‚Äôs not quite what you‚Äôll fine. The top couple of floors of this apartment block have been converted to very small studios with a bed, shower and electric hob. It wasn‚Äôt bad at all but we felt their description was a little misleading"
"This place is TINY. Not ideal for those who prefer having space. We had 3 adults and often ran into each other. The bed/couch was really only big enough for 1 person, but the loft bed was big enough for 2. We personally found the beds to be too firm and uncomfortable. There is no air conditioning, but temperatures were in the 70s, so it was fine. The bathroom is also really tiny, but had a decent sized shower.  We found that there was a strong, unpleasant odor in the room that we believe came from the kitchen sink.  However, the place is right off the Champs Elysees with a quick walk to the Arc and metro stations. Within a 20 minute walk you could also visit the Eiffel Tower and many other landmarks. The noise in the building was remarkably low and we rarely heard others or the noise from the busy street. The building is secure and we always felt safe. Also, there are 2 nearby famous macaron shops so don‚Äôt forget to stop at these. I would return to Lincoln‚Äôs place, but only if I had less people in my group. I found 3 people to be too many in such a tiny apartment."
"This is the response I sent to my hosts. Your apt did have everything as described. It is a sunny two bedroom apt, on the 5th floor with an elevator. It worked out for both of us to have an earlier check in and that was appreciated. However, This apartment has several flaws which is why I will not recommend it on air b n b. The main room was tidy, but it was not at all clean. The Main bedroom had long cobwebs coming from all the base boards all along the floor. You have an ant infestation in the main bedroom., this needs to be addressed before it gets worse. There was piles of laundry on the floor in one of the rooms. Your bathtub does not drain, so you are standing in a pool of water during your shower. The kitchen, first the fridge had not been cleaned out and was filthy before we put our food in. You have live green mold spores growing on the ledge, which is extremely unhealthy, especially if you have a baby .Your nespresso machine does not look like its been cleaned in years, and yet you advertise it on your site, and you do not provide any pods. The washing machine was a huge disappointment. We had just extended our stay in Paris for another week, and planned on doing laundry when we arrived at your flat. I understand this was due to the information you gave us that the people before us broke it. Apparently the same people before us broke the fans for the apartment as well, which is why you had no fans to offer. This information should have been disclosed to us before we arrived, we would ve found another apartment, as your contract said you had one. If your washing machine has broken, then offer your guests more than one towel for the week. I understand you have not done many air b n bs, so I will allow some suggestions for you, as we ve been to many. Cleanliness is very very important to people its almost the number one thing we look for, your apartment needs some serious deep cleaning before you rent it out. Have more towels and face clothes for your guests. Have the basics provided, including garbage bags, linen for the dishes (one towel not enough if we cannot clean it) if you offer nespresso machine, clean it and offer some pods. Provide paper towels, and toilet paper. One roll of toilet paper is ridiculous. Fix anything broken like your washer, and bathroom before its rented out again. Offer fans for this apartment, a sunny 2 bedroom will be hot, people will know this, I asked you this before I rented it out, and you did not answer me. If you do not plan on offering any of these things, then just disclose it ahead of time so people know what to expect. I trust you will accept this information..."
"Vincent is good host, in terms of communication and responsiveness. The apartment is located in an active neighborhood with a lot of restaurants and close to the metro station, place de la Bastille, Canal Saint Martin, etc. but unfortunately the apartment is in need of too much attention, it has a funny smell, all surfaces were dusty and dirty, the bathroom was really dirty and the bathtub was disgustingly clogged. The kitchen despite of being well equipped has also rotten food -maybe left by other guests- what gives you an indication of how deep their cleaning is. My experience was not good at all with this apartment."
There isn't shower equipment. A lot of noise from the floor above every night. there aren't in any bathroom trash bins. There isn't water protection glass during the shower. Very difficulty process for receiving apartment keys. Nice location because it is near to Metro station Gare de Lyon. A lot of lack of kitchen and apartment equipment.
"The place has a good location. The train station is very close to the address. I will only recommend to the host to have a note on his post: there are stairs to go on the first floor in the building without an elevator. A person like me ( old and with health issues ) will never be able to go on by herself and bring in luggage‚Äôs to the first floor without an elevator. Another issue is: when you arrive to the address and gets off the taxi you will have to go to another address to get the keys for a check in and if you are alone it‚Äôs not easy to walk down the street carrying on your luggage‚Äôs. So, it was really bad situation for me. In the very small studio there is only two plugs to be used. One in the kitchen and another in the bathroom which makes a very difficult to you to charge your phone and also very uncomfortable to use your computer to work. Few things must be fixed on that place to receive foreign hostess."
"Low rating because of insects. Host was friendly on arrival but became defensive and hostile when we brought up the problem. We found an insect infestation beside the bed on our final night which was unfortunate as we were disturbed as we had slept there already. I asked for a refund for that night as we weren‚Äôt able to sleep and it was too late to find other accommodation. He responded by calling us scammers saying we must have brought them from ‚Äòour country‚Äô . Then claiming we caused damages that were already there. What a shame! the flat is shabby chic. Great location for the price!The toilet needs cleaned/ replaced. The shower runs hots and cold. The front door is difficult to open. Outside the street is a construction site. The flat is charming aside from the insects, dust and cluttered surfaces. Also no full length mirror makes getting ready in the morning awkward."
