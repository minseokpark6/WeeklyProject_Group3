      "['Lovely experience staying on a house boat which I have always admired from a distance. The views were amazing. The living space was very clean and with very comfortable beds. Small kitchenette with ample dishes and cutlery. It was great for our takeaways to have our picnics and drinks on the deck while watching the activity on the Seine and also seeing people going about their day on shore. Great proximity to the Gare de Lyon and other transport links. Our hosts were thoughtful and kind, and checked on how we were doing with staying on the boat. We enjoyed the gentle rocking of the boat. It will be one of my best travel memories, and was a wonderful and charming way to have stayed in Paris. Merci, Isabelle and Aymeric.', 'Thank you Elysabeth for your review', 'Place as described.Good experience  in an unusual place.‚öìÔ∏èClose to all amenitiesThree nice accueil üôÇ', 'Dear Isabelle,We thank you for the beautiful accommodation. We had a good time in Paris and will be happy to remember it. We wish you all the best. Best regards,Pietro, Sara and InaüòÜüòÅüòÑü•ãüå∏', 'Great place to stay. Everything super uncomplicated and a good location. There is a star deduction because of the distinct oil odor in the room. The host may be able to help. Nevertheless,  we felt very comfortable and can definitely recommend the accommodation.', \"Hello, This is the central heating that is fuel oil. If you close the room door tightly, there's no smell. I'm very sorry\", 'Unique experience staying in a room of a boat with small bathroom. Good space for 3 people. The deck view was wonderful. Only was rocking between 8-11pm when the dinner boat cruises where turning. A water cooker and fridge were useful amenities for us. Hasa heater, in case it gets cold.', 'Caution. Bed swings even without alcohol. :-)', 'it met our expectations', 'Our stay was the crowning glory of our trip to France. The location was super convenient - close to Gare de Lyon & Quai de Gare metro stop. The hosts were very warm. We will be happy to come back.', 'Thank you Yvonne for your review', 'Our stay at this houseboat by the Seine was great! The location is perfect, close to Lyon train station, just a few minutes walk from a few restaurants, all with stunning views of the banks of the Seine and a peaceful atmosphere that allows you to escape the hustle and bustle of the city.The interior of the houseboat was charming and well appointed, offering all the comforts for a pleasant stay. We loved waking up to the gentle sensation of rocking and the calm of the water all .  Isabelle and Aymeric received us and were very welcoming.We highly recommend this houseboat to anyone looking for a unique experience in Paris. This is a perfect getaway for nature lovers and those looking to experience the city from a different perspective. Thanks to Isabelle and Aymeric for this unforgettable experience!\"', 'Thank you very much for your appreciation. It makes us even more eager to continue sharing our boat. See you soon!!!', \"We had a lovely stay at Isabelle and Aymeric's. Our hosts were very helpful and kind. We were able to rest well after hectic days in Paris.\", \"Charming and something different. The three of them were perfect on the beautiful boat of the two. For very tall people, it may be a little low with the ceiling height of about 1.9 meters. It's all there, what you need. Coffee in the morning is also available.. a small table and chairs, we also had breakfast on the boat in the morning. The bathroom cannot be heated directly - if you open the door, it goes quite well. A small seating area on the deck is also provided. We liked it very much, we will be happy to come back and highly recommend the hosts. The location is great, three metro stations are within walking distance.\", 'Great welcome from Isabelle and Aymeric. the boat matches the photos. very good for a short stay in Paris for 3 people.', 'All as described and fine.', 'it was wonderful.', 'We greatly enjoyed our stay. It was comfortable and clean, and we slept very well being on the water. Isabelle was very responsive and helpful. It was a unique experience that I highly recommend! It was also near a train station that made it easy to get around.', \"We enjoyed our stay at their place. It was a unique experience that we would be happy to reproduce.  Since it's Paris, it's next to everything. Aymeric was very friendly and cordial. We were able to enjoy our time on the houseboat. Thanks again and maybe see you next time!\", 'Enjoyed being rocked to sleep on this houseboat.', 'Original and cozy accommodation, with the dimensions of the spaces of a small (chalutier?), sometimes subject to the remnants of river traffic, with a very nice private terrace.We stayed there with our little girl, 12, who loved it.', 'We received clear instructions to access the boat, I had a little vertigo for the 1st footbridge then we get used to it, the boat is well appointed, not very large but sufficient. The boat mocked a little when boats pass over the Seine, you get used to it quickly, but the water that taps on the hull resonates well, provide quiet balls if you are sensitive to noise. Otherwise, a very nice little terrace for an aperitif, it is truly an atypical accommodation that is located 5 minutes from Gare de Lyon and the metro. Go without a second thought;-)', 'Thank you gwen for your review. Normally there is an ashtray on the terrace and a rug at the door entrance. The boat has been completely repainted and the ashtray and carpet have not been put back!!! Sorry!!!Thank you and maybe see you soon!!Isabelle', 'We enjoyed our stay. A unique experience and easy to get around the city.', 'Thank you for your feedback. I am so sorry that you found the room with dirt and dust. We have been renting the room for 5 years, and cleanliness has always been at the top!! Maybe there was a little oversight!! We apologize!!!', 'A really speciallll and well located place.The difficulties with check-in were resolved very kindly after about an hour. We lacked the breakfast basket in the descriptions.Somewhat strong diesel smell, otherwise an unforgettable stay.', 'Our stay at Le P√©lican was simply perfect! We loved the location and amenities. The small deck is perfect for a 5@7 or breakfast. Nearby Gare de Lyon makes it a prime location to visit Paris. We would highly recommend!', 'This is a truly unique location. The view on deck at night is amazing. The accommodation is basic, but if you‚Äôre looking for a base in Paris it‚Äôs perfect. Central paris is 2 stops away, and local bars/restaurants are 10 minutes away.  Top tips - bring some mosquito spray for hot summer nights', 'Thank you Charlotte for your rating. I would like to point out that there is a mosquito spray in the bathroom under the porthole as well as a sponge in the bathroom cabinet drawer. In case of need we are always available to you. Sincerely,', 'Beautiful experience sleeping on the Seine. The Pelican is really well equipped üòÄ', \"Just like last year, our accommodation on the Pelican was great. The contact with our hosts was very pleasant and courteous. We'll be there again. Ulrike and Joerg\", 'Mrs. Isabelle was very kind and friendly in welcoming us.The experience on a boat was pleasant and interesting.Our 12-year-old granddaughter loved it.Due to the disturbed weather, fortunately, there were no parties nearby so at night the place was very quiet.The closets under the beds were locked so the space to store our clothes was a little small.However, a unique experience that we will remember positively.', \"The most pleasant stay with a very nice couple's welcome.\", 'It was very nice ü§©', 'Isabelle and Aymeric have been very nice, helpful and easy to get in contact with. We were at the Pelican a couple of hours before check-in, and we contacted Isabelle. She replied immediately and we could check-in some hours before scheduled. That was really nice. The boat itself is authentic and a good choice for those looking for something special. We were a family of 4 (two adults and our son age 20 and daughter age 16). Being four we felt the space was a bit tight. There are three beds, and two of them are labeled as double beds, but they are not very wide for two adults to sleep in. The area is quite noisy with party boats nearby (maybe not all year round), we were ok with this and had expected noise when in the middle of Paris, but some might find the dance music until late at night disturbing. The boat is not far from Gare de Lyon, and metro is easy to get around. The Pelican is a great and fun alternative to a traditional apartment or hotel, price is good and hosts are nice.', 'Beautiful accommodation, super friendly hosts. The space was clean and tidy with beautiful views.', 'This is a very charming place, on a boat on the Seine river, next to the Gare de Lyon and a walking distance from so many beautiful places in Paris. The hosts were very responsive, provided us with their cell phone numbers and there was a bottle of sparkling wine, some cookies waiting for us as a welcome gift. The cabin is small but cute and functional. You could find more comfort for the same price in the same neighbourhood, but not the charm of a boat, with amazing lights at sunrise, an amazing sunset and beautiful night lights on the river. Some reviews have mentioned mosquitos, or noise, but we had none of that although we left the windows open and our stay included a Friday night in July. The cabin can be hot in the first hours of the night but every night it cooled down and we slept very well. There is a bakery 3 min away from the boat, the Gare de Lyon is a 5 min walk, and there are many bistronomic (a trend in Paris) restaurants 10-15 min away by feet. All in all a great stay', 'Thank you patrice for your review', 'Fantastic location, very friendly hosts.  Loved our stay', 'The place is fine:)It is a litlle romantic and not big. If you have wi-fi problem just put yous ass on a bed :)', 'Unique place Lots of charmMagical Boat Bridge Nighting & Breakfast Maybe a little warm in the middle of summer', 'We were very well received. Magical location and exceptional views of the Seine. Sensational experience. Everything was perfect! We recommend.', 'Fantastic stay. Wonderful location, easy to walk to restaurants, points of interest, and train stations. The boat is very smooth and doesn‚Äôt rock. Sat in the deck watching the sunset over the river. Just beautiful. Hosts are very proactive. They also brought baked goods and juice, doing things that made us feel very welcomed.', 'The landlords were super friendly and just great.If you want something special in Paris, this is the place to be', \"Not too lucky for our period. 3 consecutive nights of extreme night disturbances due to evenings on the shore opposite. Total inability to sleep‚Ä¶ so we cut our stay by one night (3 out of 4) to be able to recover. We have informed our host by email because we are not there. Too bad we didn't get back‚Ä¶\", \"We're disappointed with your review!!! You did not receive a message from us because you had already left the boat in a hurry at the time we  received your message. In fact, we weren't at home by the time you left. We would have preferred that you notify us of your departure beforehand because the door remained open!!!You slept on a boat at a local's place and indeed the noise pollution is part of the charm of the capital and the banks of the Seine.I advise you for the next time to take a hotel that will cost you much more!!!\", \"Staying on the houseboat was great fun! It had a beautiful view and was very convenient to two train stations - Gare de Lyon and Gare d'Austerlitz. We had a wonderful stay.\", 'The boat is beautiful, super manicured. The reception was perfect with a bottle of sparkling wine. The accommodation is perfect for a couple. It was a great experience. Highly recommended', 'A lovely houseboat on the Seine with a beautiful view and great deck. The deck above was lovely and a great way to start each morning. Hosts were communicative and helpful -- would recommend this to anyone heading to Paris!', 'Great Location. Fun for the kids living on a boat. Breakfast selection was delicious (& choclate-y).  Waves from the river created a unique experience. Would recommend to friends and family.', 'We had a magical time at Isabelle and Aymeric‚Äôs boat. The views were spectacular and the space was so comfortable. I would highly recommend.', 'Isabel and Aymeric were very friendly, the boat was cosy and charming and in a great location: loved having a beer on deck and watching the boats go by. And the city lights reflected in the water after dark. Convenient walk from Gare de Lyon and several metro stations, restaurants a short walk away at Bercy. Enjoyed walks and scenery along the Seine, sound of water. We had perfect sunny weather; some weather conditions might make it less ideal,  but can‚Äôt say about that.', 'Nice and cozy crib house with a unique experience, friendly host and breakfast.', 'This place might not be for everyone but we truley loved it. Waking up overlooking the Seine and watch boats passing by is a great experience. The bathroom might be a challenge if you are a bit bigger. Within 15 mins walk to ile sant louis and with a supermarket around the corner this is a great place to start your day in Paris.', 'Wonderfully located in the Seine, very central', 'Clean, quiet and good location. Matches photos and other reviews. Recommended', 'Good location, sufficient for a short trip, special accommodation, nicely furnished inside, terrace beautiful, but could still be designed something. Unfortunately, the requested welcome basket was not available.', 'We had a lovely stay on the Pelican. If you‚Äôre looking for something a bit different to a hotel then it‚Äôs a great option. Isabelle was always responsive with replies to our questions and everything was as advertised. The boat is a 5 minute walk from the Metro so getting around is no problem. We are a family of 2 adults and 2 children and space was a bit tight but if you‚Äôre a couple or travelling with one child it would be perfect. I have no hesitation in recommending the Pelican.', 'Lovely stay!', 'Our daughters and I stayed for a night and it was great. Fun to stay on the water and just as described. Hosts were kind and easy to communicate with. It was a great stay.', 'Very nice welcome, atypical stay, well placed, practical! We recommend it', 'Very nice accommodation in the heart of Paris.Small peaceful harbor after a long day sightseeing.', \"a perfect stay! it's almost missing! we get used to being on a boat! I'll be back!\", 'Nice location. Very easily accessible & fast at various subways.Location was great! Isabelle is very friendly, responsive and very helpful tips on how to get to the stay. Absolutely recommended!Money value for money, more than good.', \"Very nice hosts. The gentle swings were very nice.  The room is designed with attention to detail and clean. However, you should not be delicately. You have to come from the gare de lyon through a stagnant tunnel with homeless tents (the children were really scared and we always went a detour. The hosts write, it is harmless but you are approached and it is uncomfortable). In the room it smells quite like engine oil. Unfortunately, the bathroom is a disaster. No heating, a little run down and so small that you can't move (if you are 1.95 m tall at least). If you are looking for an adventure, no comfort and is not squeamish, it is absolutely recommended and an unforgettable experience!\", 'The Pelican is a super cozy accommodation in close proximity to public transport and definitely worth a stay. Thank you very much Isabelle er Aymeric...', 'the people are very  welcoming and very kind, the accommodation is  comfortable, metro nearby, small narrow bathroom for a large person, I would advise not to come at night to find the houseboat even if the description is perfect;) This houseboat is a little paradise *_*', \"The stay was perfect! the little touches that Isabelle Et Aymeric provided made us feel so welcomed. I'd recommend staying here 100%.\", 'It was wonderful! Great location, great host. Definite recommendation', 'Atypical and rather quiet place. Close to the Bastille and nation for the different outings.  We loved this surprising place with a warm welcome and the pleasure of lapping on the hull of the boat.We recommend this experience', 'A good experience living on the Seine! Comfortable and clean accommodation with heating, hot water and all the comforts. The owners Isabelle and Aymeric were very friendly and welcoming, they also offered us sweets and brioches for breakfast on the first day. Highly recommended.', 'Thank you! It was absolutely lovely.', 'This place was very good for us!Highlight is the walking distance of downtown, from 2 train stations and 1 metro station in the different directions city!And falling asleep in the evening with the gentle waves of the Seine is something special!Thanks to the hosts, happy to come again!', 'We had a very nice stay aboard the houseboat. Close to several metro stations, it is easy to get around ‚Äî as well as find it thanks to the precise indications of Aymeric and Isabelle, which have also shown a lot of responsiveness and sympathy. The airbnb is small (ideal for 2), but everything you need for a smooth stay. We were not disappointed and will be happy to come back again:) Thank you!', \"great ship in great spot, lovely beds, welcoming hosts who personally welcomed us.  Recommended, we'd love to come back again!\", 'Enjoy our stay.  We would love to come back. Close to the metro as well as to the international bus stop.', 'We had a great time and were very happy to have discovered this great place. Loving furnishings and support.', 'Our stay was very nice. The location of the boat is great and since the metro stations are within walking distance, you can easily reach all the sights in a reasonable time.The place has everything you need and offers everything you need. We stayed in Paris for 3 nights and were very comfortable there. As it is a boat, the space here is relatively limited. Not an issue for us, but especially in the bathroom it gets relatively tight.', 'This was a great place to stay. We slept like babies. Located near to 3 different stations and the Host Aymeric was friendly and helpful. Would stay here again.', 'A special and extraordinary retreat in a metropolis where you can get so many impressions. We enjoyed the days on the Pelican and in the city to the fullest in beautiful weather. There is everything needed and we would like to come back immediately.Isabelle and Aymeric are very attentive hosts.', 'Just a great place to explore Paris from, fabulous hosts who go the extra mile', 'Great stay. Unique experience! Opening window ports helped cool off room in afternoon. Nice breeze. Isabelle answered all our questions promptly. Be prepared for outdoor music on Friday nights.  Loved the private patio.', \"very nice atypical place, very nice, sunset over the extra Seine. The hosts are very kind and know how to make your stay very very pleasant.Great location to visit all of Paris.Don't hesitate....\", \"Wonderful stay! Breakfast was convenient and the location was great due to it's proximity to train stations. Clean and great view.\", 'We unfortunately could not stay due to medical emergency but host communication was excellent', 'Very good total change of scenery, on the Seine, to do, Paris is still very noisy. Otherwise the rest is perfect.', 'Unusual accommodation ideal for visiting Paris or a magical stay!', 'Great hosts, warm, reliable and helpful. The boat is a very special place to stay in when visiting Paris. A breakfast basket at our door every morning and a boat cabin with all one might need if visiting for a few days. The deck has a gorgeous sunset view. The location is very good for public transport and easy to navigate. The area is lively in the evenings, music heard from nearby boats that are cafes or bars and from across the river. This might be a disturbance if you want quiet evening hours, but for us it added to the excitement of the area. We were on vacation, so some noise did not bother us. The Seine is a busy river in the summer, we had fun watching all different kind of boats passing by. During the night it was very quiet. All in all, a memorable stay in Paris.', \"It was our first experience on a 'houseboat' and everything went well. the location is very convenient to visit Paris, close to many stations. we enjoyed the Seine at various times of the day and it was special. The room has everything you need, obviously on a boat size, but nothing was missing. Isabelle welcomed us with kindness and kindness the first day and even if she only speaks French, she understood. Definitely an experience to recommend. In the following days she was not on the boat but responded very quickly to our questions through the app.\", \"This place was a great location and central to everything we needed. The hosts were very welcoming and they gave us a cute breakfast every morning and a bottle of champagne. Perfect hosts! The only thing I would say is that there was an unsettling  amount of Spiders this season(they said it was very rare). I guess that's what you can expect on the water but everything else was great. The host were great at trying to get rid of the webs but they just came back the next day. Would 100% recommend if you don't mind the critters.\", 'very nice houseboat, Isabelle was very nice :)', 'A really great place to stay in Paris. Lovely to be on the water. Isabelle was a great host', 'Simply magical! Very clean and cozy room, beautiful view, nice hosts and houseboat close to all amenities! Thanks again', 'Great stay. Parisian life along the way. A breathtaking view, especially at sunset over the Seine, a magical moment when Paris lights up after dark. Thanks to Isabelle and Aymeric for the breakfast provisions.', 'Great location on the Seine. Lovely view of the city. Nice and private. Minutes away from the Metro. Close proximity to grocery shop and restaurants. Owners were kind and welcoming. Would recommend and definitely would do it again.', 'Cozy stay with very nice hosts. For the warm welcome there was a breakfast served every morning. On deck you can end the evening nicely or start the day in the sunshine. Definitely worth a visit! Thank you for everything.', \"Fantastic accommodation in the middle of Paris on the Seine. A lovely couple who provided us with breakfast.We had a wonderful time to ourselves.I'd love to come back.\", 'nice welcome, beautiful place, to try without hesitation', 'We had a lovely stay on board the Pelican! Isabelle and Aymeric were fabulous hosts! Our breakfasts and a sunset picnic on the deck were the best! We watched the sun sink over the Seine as dinner cruises passed and even had a fun experience of sharing a toast (across our deck to theirs) with those cruising by! It was dreamy! I highly recommend staying on the Pelican!', \"Our stay on the Pelican was spotless and very nice. The hosts are attentive and warm, nothing to complain about at all. The place is quiet and well located. We'll definitely definitely come back aboard the Pelican üåä\", 'Thank you to Isabelle and Aymeric for a wonderful couple of days on The Pelican. We were travelling with our 4 month old daughter on her first holiday and our stay was perfect. We were able to enjoy the lovely breakfast provided each day by the hosts, on the terrace over the Seine. They gave us some great recommendations for great meals  in the evening- and the boat‚Äôs location is great. You can walk to most of the best places to visit in Paris- both landmarks and areas- and most of it doable along the river. Much better than any hotel! Also right next to Gare De Lyon and Metro stations. Thanks again!', \"Isabelle and Aymeric's boat is a wonderful place to stay for your visit in Paris. Easily accessible and because you are on the Seine, it is relatively quiet there. The terrace was the place for us in the morning and evening to start and discuss the day. Because what an amazing city Paris is anyway. Inside it is compact. You'll need to be prepared for that. If you have length, you have to bend a lot. But it is very cozy. Despite the cozy space, it's well-equipped with everything you need for a morning and evening. Compliments to Isabelle and Aymeric that they can offer such a nice place. Highly recommended!\", \"It's a wonderful Airbnb!! We loved our stay in the boat. It is well equipped and decorated and near Gare de Lyon. The view from the Seine is pretty too! And the hosts are super nice and patient. Thanks so much for a great experience! This is the coolest Airbnb I have ever stayed in! The hosts are kind and were very flexible with us when plans changed. They had wonderful suggestions for places to eat, and they had a basket of breakfast foods for us! It was very comfortable and in a great location. Not too busy, but close to the metro and train. I can't wait to stay here again.\", \"Really lovely boat with an lovely host! Everything was organised perfectly, she was there when you wanted to ask something. Every morning a nice little breakfast. I would really recommend this place because it's something different. You are on a boat, on the water with an amazing view, beds, shower, you got everything you need. All the hotspots are nearby via metro or bus. If you really want to experience something else, the Pelican is where you want to be!\", 'Beautiful, uncomplicated, happy to come again!', 'This was an enjoyable experience and much more comfortable and spacious than it looks in the pictures. The bathroom is tiny but completely functional. Thanks for a fun stay!', 'We spent 2 magical nights on the Pelican. My daughter loved it and so did we.We were welcomed like kings. Breakfast at the top.Real happiness! We will return without hesitation', 'Atypical and warm accommodation for a romantic weekend. The night life on the docks is very pleasant. And there is no noise problem. The cabin is very well insulated.The neighborhood is nicer than expected. I recommend Parc Bercy, very pleasant.', 'The four day stay on the boat was a great pleasure. We all slept very well on the ship!', \"A great place to stay and something very special to do in Paris. Unfortunately, the weather was a bit modest, so we couldn't take advantage of the deck. We could have a breakfast in the sun and it was great. Otherwise, the check-in was super unproblematic and with the wifi everything worked perfectly. The only drawback is actually traveling by car. It is therefore advisable to arrive by public transport or to book a spot in the parking garage online  (at least two days). The host is very friendly, the communication was mostly online, also because of the language barrier, which was no problem at all. We can well imagine visiting the PELICAN again.\", 'The boat is super nice and clean. There is a delicious breakfast and the hosts are very courteous.For a city trip, it is very recommended!', 'Thank you - Isabelle is a very attentive hostess and responded very promptly  to all our questions, accommodated a slight change to the booking easily and gave us clear directions from the station. It was a fun stay on the boat - excellently situated for seeing plenty of sites - and mostly dry which was great! Thank you!', 'Great, unique stay! Beautiful in the evening. Only drawback is ceilings were very low‚Äîif you were 6 ft tall you would not be able to stand up.', \"Very well located to shine in Paris and make the most of the city's assets! In addition, Isabelle and Aymeric gave us a particularly warm welcome. Atypical accommodation for a charming stay or a dream family stay! Will be back!\", 'Super nice experience.

Welcoming, neat and cozy.', 'an extraordinary experience. to do and redo. donot hesitate', 'Everything was absolutely perfect!Thank you so much', 'Hello,Isabelle and Aymeric are hosts who respond quickly. The location of the houseboat is ideal for a few days in Paris. Instead, prioritize the spring summer period to make the most of it. The beds are not suitable for small children.', \"A great place!Located near Gare de Lyon, there's quick access to public transportation in any direction.And it's a really fun and unique experience staying on a boat :)\", \"Ideally located close to Gare de Lyon, close to several metro and RER lines, very pleasant stay with my 9-year-old son. Comfortable cabin although everything is kept to a minimum, as described.

I have no word to convey the happiness of this stay, Aymeric of incredible availability, everything was perfect... we don't want to go out when we stay on the Pelican... The fly boats passing while you are on the terrace... it's an incredible experience... I will surely go back to the Pelican, I recommend it, my daughters loved it..\", 'Great! Thank you for this trip aboard the Pelican', 'Awesome in the middle of Paris. Atypical and comfortable for a beautiful experience by the Seine', 'A unique experience.', 'A very good weekend on the Pelican! This boat is lovely! We loved sleeping in this atypical, a little magical place. Moored not far from a subway mouth, we enjoyed reaching it in the evening. Very close to Lyon train station, it was very convenient for us to be able to drop off the luggage as soon as we arrived. Aymeric is a welcoming, reliable host. Very discreet, we saw it very little as if it offered us its place to live. Thanks Aymeric for the beautiful gift! See you next time. Good wind!

I can highly recommend...', 'The boat is in a good location fairly close to a major train station. The hosts give very good instructions on how to best get to the boat so if you follow those you‚Äôll have no trouble getting there. It is very cosy and there‚Äôs plenty of room and the hosts are very friendly and welcoming. It is on the river so expect a few boats to pass by now and then, more so in the late morning to afternoon, and with them some slight waves. Overall a fantastic experience and something different.', 'We all loved staying on the P√©lican. My 2 friends are still congratulating me for finding it, but really, thanks are due to Aymeric for providing the perfect platform from which to see Paris!', 'My teenage daughter and I had 4 nights stay at Isabelle and Aymerics wonderful houseboat. The boat is situated very close to Metro stations, which will bring you to the heart of Paris in no time. Shopping including bakery within few minutes walk. The room was spacious, clean and the terrance overlooking the Seine a perfect place for relaxing and enjoying early mornings at the Seine. All communication was fast and precise, despite our lack of French language. As a great help we could store our luggage at the boat for our late departure. This place is for sure high value for the money', 'nice and cosy stay on the Seine', 'Isabelle Et Aymeric, takes care of their hosts.The room is very clean and the bedding comfortable.Breakfast is hearty and can be taken on the back deck.Change of scenery guaranteed by being in Paris!!!', \"Wonderfully individual and well-kept accommodation in Paris, very close to Gare de Lyon. Celebrating on neighboring boats at night but didn't strengthen us.\", \"We stayed three nights on the boat as a city trip. There was just enough space for us four people. We were two adults and two children of the age of six and seven years. The children loved the boat, as well as the owner's cat. The room is actually quite spacy, with enough room for small suitcases. The bathroom is small though, for one person at a time. The windows can be opened to let fresh air in, however beware of the mosquitos at night. The outer deck area is perfect to relax and have a drink or breakfast. The beds are very comfortable and cozy. Bring your earplugs if you have a light sleep. I had a hard time falling asleep due to music on the bar / party boats closeby. The owner Aymeric is very friendly, open and welcoming. He really is an excellent host.
